N. B. Gödel’s birthday is actually April 28<sup>th</sup> (1906), and the
date of his death is January 14<sup>th</sup> (1978). Einstein’s birthday
is on March 14<sup>th</sup> (1879), a date which will be important for
the beginning of the public recognition of Gödel’s achievements, and the
date of his death is April 18<sup>th</sup> (1955), a date that will mark
the beginning of Gödel’s increasing intellectual isolation at IAS. This
puzzle is based on one published in the *New York Times*:
