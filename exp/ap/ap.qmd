Classically, logic has been thought of as the study of *deductive proof*
or *derivations*. In the last few decades, however, a more dynamic view
of logical reasoning has emerged. Rational agents perform many cognitive
reasoning tasks other than making deductions from a given set of
premises. Common sense reasoning includes reasoning about the beliefs,
knowledge, and logical reasoning of other agents. Reasoning is not just
the construction of static derivations but dynamical events involving
the flow of information based on public statements and inferences that
can be made on the basis of what others know or don’t know. The
following puzzle illustrates this usefulness of this kind of dynamic
meta-epistemological reasoning.

The date was August 26, 1930. Rudolf Carnap, Herbert Feigl and Friedrich
Waismann met with Gödel for *Sachertore* and Viennese coffee at Café
Reichsrat. Gödel was excited to share with his friends his discovery.
This meeting a the café was about one month before the Second *Tagung
for Erkentnishlehre der exackten Wissenschaften* to be held in
Konigsberg in September, where Gödel would make the first public
announcement of his revolutionary result, the (First) Incompleteness
Theorem.

Although his associates from the Vienna Circle—Rudolf, Herbert, and
Friedrich—could sense an undercurrent of excitement in Kurt’s manner,
his cautious and measured remarks were deeper than they could, or were
willing, to grasp, at that time. Rudolf decided to change the subject.
"When is your birthday, Kurt?" he inquired. Gödel thought for a moment
and wrote down a napkin a list of 10 dates for all to see:

::: {}

| | | |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| January 14 | January 15 | January 18 |
| March 14 | March 23 | |
| April 18 | April 28 | |
| May 15 | May 22 | May 28 |

Kurt said, "My birthday is one of these." Then taking a couple more
napkins, he jotted down the *month* of his birthday and gave it to
Herbert. On the other he jotted down the *date* of his birthday and gave
it to Friedrich. Neither Herbert nor Friedrich could see what was
written on each other’s napkin.

"Can you prove when my birthday is?" Kurt asked Herbert. The following
conversation ensued.

::: {}

| | |
|--:|:--|
| [Herbert]{.smallcaps}: | I *don’t* *know* when your birthday is, but I *know* Friedrich *doesn’t know* either. |
| [Friedrich]{.smallcaps}: | I *didn’t know* at first, but now I *do know*! |
| [Herbert]{.smallcaps}: | Then I also *know* when Kurt’s birthday is! |

: {tbl-colwidths="[10,90]"}

:::

[Rudolf]{.smallcaps}, who heard the exchange, correctly deduced Kurt’s birthday. How
did he do this? You may assume everyone is an *ideal logician*: they are
not lying or confused and are capable of making logically accurate
inferences on the basis of the information disclosed.

### Solution to the *Sachertore* at Café Reichsrat Puzzle

First arrange the list of possible birthdays in a matrix by month and by
day:

```{=html}
<table class="bordered">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 20%" />
<col style="width: 20%" />
<col style="width: 10%" />
<col style="width: 10%" />
<col style="width: 10%" />
<col style="width: 10%" />
<col style="width: 10%" />
<col style="width: 10%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td rowspan="5" style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; color: #FF0000"><span class="smallcaps" style="color: #FF0000">Herbert</span></td>
<td></td>
<td colspan="6" style="text-align: center; color: #000090"><span class="smallcaps" style="">Friedrich</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>January</td>
<td>14</td>
<td>15</td>
<td>18</td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>March</td>
<td>14</td>
<td></td>

<td>28</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>May</td>
<td></td>
<td>15</td>
<td></td>
<td>22</td>
<td></td>
<td>28</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
```

Our first clue is that:

> [Herbert]{.smallcaps} said, "I don’t know when your birthday is, but I know [Friedrich]{.smallcaps} doesn’t know either."

[Herbert]{.smallcaps}, of course, doesn’t know since he’s only been given the month.
However, Hebert’s *publicly announcing* that he *knows* that [Friedrich]{.smallcaps}
doesn’t *know* gives everyone some new information.

Rudolf *deduces* that Hebert has been given neither the months of March
nor May. Why? Because each those months have unique dates, namely, 22
and 23. If [Friedrich]{.smallcaps} had been given either of these dates, he would have
been able immediately to deduce Kurt’s birthday. Since [Herbert]{.smallcaps} says he
*knows* this is not the case, Rudolf can deduce that [Herbert]{.smallcaps} has *not*
been given either March or May.

<col style="width: 10%" />
<col style="width: 10%" />
<col style="width: 10%" />
<col style="width: 10%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td rowspan="5" style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; color: #FF0000"><span class="smallcaps" style="color: #FF0000">Herbert</span></td>
<td></td>
<td colspan="6" style="text-align: center; color: #000090"><span class="smallcaps" style="">Friedrich</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>January</td>
<td>14</td>
<td>15</td>
<td>18</td>

<tr>

<td>14</td>

<tr>
<td>April</td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td>18</td>

<tr>
<td style="background-color: #E5B9B7">May</td>
<td></td>
<td>15</td>
<td></td>
<td style="background-color: #E5B9B7">22</td>
<td></td>
<td>28</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
```

Our second clue is that:

> [Friedrich]{.smallcaps} said, "I didn’t know originally, but now I do!"

Since Friedrich says he now *knows* Kurt’s birthday, Rudolf may deduce
that Friedrich has *not* been given the date of the 18<sup>th</sup>, the
date is common to the months not yet been eliminated—January and April.

```{=html}
<table class="bordered">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 20%" />
<col style="width: 20%" />
<col style="width: 10%" />
<col style="width: 10%" />
<col style="width: 10%" />
<col style="width: 10%" />
<col style="width: 10%" />
<col style="width: 10%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td rowspan="5" style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; color: #FF0000"><span class="smallcaps" style="color: #FF0000">Herbert</span></td>
<td></td>
<td colspan="6" style="text-align: center; color: #000090"><span class="smallcaps" style="">Friedrich</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>January</td>
<td>14</td>
<td>15</td>
<td style="background-color: #FABF8F">18</td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="background-color: #E5B9B7">March</td>
<td>14</td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td style="background-color: #E5B9B7">23</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>April</td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td style="background-color: #FABF8F">18</td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td>28</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="background-color: #E5B9B7">May</td>
<td></td>
<td>15</td>
<td></td>
<td style="background-color: #E5B9B7">22</td>
<td></td>
<td>28</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
```

The last clue is that:

> [Herbert]{.smallcaps} said, "Then I also know when Kurt’s birthday is!""

Since Herbert now *knows* when Kurt’s birthday is too, the month given
to Herbert cannot be January since in that case, *two* possible dates
would been remaining *after* the 18th was eliminated.

```{=html}
<table class="bordered">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 20%" />
<col style="width: 20%" />
<col style="width: 10%" />
<col style="width: 10%" />
<col style="width: 10%" />
<col style="width: 10%" />
<col style="width: 10%" />
<col style="width: 10%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td rowspan="5" style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; color: #FF0000"><span class="smallcaps" style="color: #FF0000">Herbert</span></td>
<td></td>
<td colspan="6" style="text-align: center; color: #000090"><span class="smallcaps" style="">Friedrich</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="background-color: #E5DFEC">January</td>
<td>14</td>
<td>15</td>
<td style="background-color: #FABF8F">18</td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="background-color: #E5B9B7">March</td>
<td>14</td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td style="background-color: #E5B9B7">23</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>April</td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td style="background-color: #FABF8F">18</td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td>28</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="background-color: #E5B9B7">May</td>
<td></td>
<td>15</td>
<td></td>
<td style="background-color: #E5B9B7">22</td>
<td></td>
<td>28</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
```

Having eliminated the months of May and June, and then the date of the
18th and then the month of January, Rudolf deduces that Kurt’s birthday
is April 28<sup>th</sup>.

## N.B.

Gödel’s birthday is actually April 28<sup>th</sup> (1906), and the
date of his death is January 14<sup>th</sup> (1978). Einstein’s birthday
is on March 14<sup>th</sup> (1879), a date which will be important for
the beginning of the public recognition of Gödel’s achievements, and the
date of his death is April 18<sup>th</sup> (1955), a date that will mark
the beginning of Gödel’s increasing intellectual isolation at IAS. This
puzzle is based on one published in the [*New York Times*](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/15/science/a-math-problem-from-singapore-goes-viral-when-is-cheryls-birthday.html).
