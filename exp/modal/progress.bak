**<span class="smallcaps">2. The Symbolic Language for Modal
Propositional Logic.</span>**

So far we have been using the new modal operators informally, but we
will now formally characterize our symbolic language. The *symbolic
language* with which we shall now deal is that of chapter II with ‘’ and
‘’ added to its symbols as modal operators.

We enrich the class of symbolic sentences to include sentences that are
the result of prefixing a symbolic sentence by a modal operator. Thus
expression such as

~ P

~ (P ∧ Q)

(P → P)

will be counted among the symbolic sentence of our language.

To be more explicit, the class of symbolic sentences is exhaustively
characterized as follows:

1.  *Sentence letters are symbolic sentences.*

2.  *If ϕ and ψ are symbolic sentences, then so are*: ~ ϕ , (ϕ → ψ) , (ϕ
    ∧ ψ) , (ϕ ∨ ψ) , and (ϕ ↔ ψ) .

3.  *If ϕ is a symbolic sentence, then so are:*

> ϕ
>
> *and*

ϕ .

The sentences obtained by clause (3) are *modal sentences* and we shall
call the occurrence of ϕ the *scope* of the modal operator.

Symbolic sentences can be parsed into *grammatical trees* to
systematically display all the sub-sentences involved it its
construction. Here, in addition to the kinds of nodes of Chapter II,
non-branching nodes are also reached by clauses (3). For example, the
symbolic sentence ‘((P → Q) → ~~R)’ can be parsed into the following
grammatical tree.

((P → Q) → ~~R)

(P→ Q) ~~ R

(P→ Q) ~ R

P Q ~ R

P R

<span id="_Toc254518020"
class="anchor"></span><span class="smallcaps">Figure 2 A Grammatical
Tree for a Modal Proposition</span>

Parsing a symbolic sentence into its grammatical tree provides a precise
description of its grammatical structure. The above symbolic sentence is
a conditional whose antecedent is the sentence formed by prefixing the
necessity operator to a conditional whose antecedent comes from
prefixing the necessity operator to ‘P’ and whose consequent is ‘Q’. The
consequent of the main conditional is a negation of a sentence that is
the result of prefixing the possibility operator to the negation of ‘R’.

We shall continue to use the informal conventions of chapters I and II
for omitting outer parentheses, replacing pairs of matching parentheses
with matching pairs of square brackets, and for resolving questions of
scope among the various connectives and operators. Now, in addition, the
modal operators ‘’ and ‘’ and ‘~’ will, by convention, have the
narrowest scope; ‘∧’, and ‘∨’ will have narrower scope than ‘→’ and ‘↔’,
and, as before, repeated conjunctions or repeated disjunctions are
grouped by association to the left. For example,

(~P ∧ Q) → \[(~R ∨ ~S ∨ T) ∧ ~P ↔ Q ∧ ~(R ∧ S ∧ ~T)\]

becomes officially

((~P ∧ Q) → ((((~R ∨ ~S) ∨ T) ∧ ~P) ↔ (Q ∧ ~((R ∧ S) ∧ ~T)))) .

# <span class="smallcaps">2. Translation and Symbolization.</span> 

The English sentence

1.  It is necessary that God exists

has a number of stylistic variants in English:

> Necessarily, God exists ,
>
> It is necessary for God to exist ,
>
> God must exist ,
>
> God has to exist .

Similarly, the sentence

1.  It is possible that God exists

may also be expressed with a number of stylistic variants:

> Possibly, God exists ,
>
> It is possible for God to exist ,
>
> God can exist ,
>
> God might exist .

Using the modal operators with the sentential connectives of chapters I
and II, we can develop stylistic variants of a number of English
expressions. For instance, the expression

It is impossible that God exists

may be paraphrased as either

It is *necessary* that God *fails* to exist ,

or

> It is *not possible* that God exists .

Modal operators, when they interact with other operators and
connectives, can create *scope ambiguities* such that that between the
necessity of the consequence and the necessity of the consequent, which
we discussed in the previous section.

### Exercises

1\. Symbolize the following sets of sentences using the given the scheme
of abbreviation. If a sentence is ambiguous briefly explain the
different possible readings.

> P: Plato is rational. R: Theatetus is a cyclist.
>
> Q: Plato is risible. S: Theatetus is bipedal.

1.  It is possible that Plato is rational, but it is not necessary that
    > Plato is rational.

It is impossible that Plato is not rational.

It is contingently true that Plato is rational.

It is neither contingently true nor contingently false that Plato is
rational.

1.  Necessarily, if Plato is risible, then Plato is rational.

> If Plato is risible, then it is necessary that Plato is rational.
>
> If it is possible that Plato is risible, then it is possible that
> Plato is rational.
>
> If Plato is risible, then it is necessarily possible that Plato is
> rational.
>
> It is impossible for Plato to be risible if he is not rational.

1.  Theatetus could be a cyclist provided he is bipedal.

> It is possible that Theatetus is both a cyclist and bipedal.
>
> It is impossible that Theatetus is a cyclist if he is not bipedal.
>
> If it is possible for Theatetus to be cyclist and necessarily if he is
> a cyclist then he is bipedal, then it is compatible that Theatetus is
> cyclist and bipedal.

1.  Use the distinction between the necessity of the consequence and the
    necessity of the consequent to explain why someone might accept
    Axiom (**B)** ϕ → ϕ as intuitively obvious while rejecting its
    logically equivalent form Axiom (**B**) ϕ → ϕ. What are the two
    way in which one might interpret “if ϕ then necessarily it is
    possible that ϕ”?

# <span class="smallcaps">3. Axioms for Modal Logics.</span> 

The logical relations in the previous section capture what is common to
the many of the various interpretations for necessity. The distinctive
notions of necessity discussed initially can be characterized by
formulating distinctive modal axioms. For example, the axiom

P → P

says that whatever is necessary is actually the case. This axiom
characterizes what some philosophers have called ‘tautological
necessity.’ This axiom would hold for temporal logics since whatever is,
was, or will be the case, is the case. This axiom, known as the (**T**)
axiom, is named after a system of modal logic studied by Gödel, Feys,
and von Wright in which *tautologies* are necessary truths.

A noted above, the (**T**) axiom is too strong for deontic logics.
George Washington, should he fail to live up to his reputation for
veracity, might be morally obligated to tell the truth but fail to do
so. It is a sad reality of moral life that obligations remain
unfulfilled. However, whatever is morally obligatory is at least morally
permissible. The (**D**) axiom (named for *deontic logic*) weakens the
(**T**) axiom and states that what is necessary is possible.

P → P .

Let’s consider another axiom, known as the (**4**) axiom (named after
the strict implication system **S4** studied by C. I. Lewis). Jaakko
Hintikka developed an epistemic interpretation using the (**4**) axiom:

P → P .

This interpretation says that if an individual knows that P, then that
individual knows that s/he knows that P. Axiom (**4)** has also been
used to characterize systems of temporal logic in which *what is always
going to be true is always always going to be true.*

Another axiom has been championed by philosophers such as Alvin
Plantinga, who claims that the notion of “broadly logical necessity” is
best captured by axiom (**5)** (named after C. I. Lewis’ fifth axiom for
strict implication):

P → P .

Whereas Axiom **4** states that necessary truths are necessary, Axiom
**5** extends this necessity to the modality of possibility: if P is
possible, then it is necessary that P is possible. Intuitively, axioms
**4** and **5**, together, require that the modal status of a truth is
not accidental, but the same in all possible world.

As noted above, the (**B**) axiom is syntactically similar to the form
of double negation valid in intuitionistic logic, the law of double
negation introduction:

P → ~~P .

By the logical equivalences noted earlier, this axiom can also be
expressed by the more familiar form:

P → P .

The (**B**) axiom also plays a role in modelling linear time as noted
earlier. Ancient philosophers like Aristotle wrote about modal logic,
and the medieval logicians such as Jean Buridan (c. 1301 –
c. 1359/62)discussed modal notions with great subtlety. However, the
modern treatment of modal logic began around 1912 when C. I. Lewis,
after reading Russell and Whitehead’s *Principia* *Mathematica*,
proposed various axioms (such as **4** and **5**) to find a connective
more suitable than the material conditional to express our informal
concept of entailment. In the 1930s Gödel discussed an interpretation of
the modal operator as ‘it is provable in system M that,’ and in the
1950s *epistemic*, *doxastic*, *deontic* and *tense-logic*
interpretations were intensively investigated.

Around the 1960s modal logic was being investigated by numerous
logicians—including, among others, Rudolf Carnap, Jaakko Hintikka,
Richard Montague, and von Wright. However, it was Saul Kripke’s
remarkable paper *A Completeness Theorem in Modal Logic* (1961)
published while he was still a high school student in Nebraska that
presented possible world semantics in an elegant way that ignited
decades of logical and philosophical research. Kripke’s possible world
semantics gave formal expression to the Leibnizian idea that a
proposition is *necessary* if it is true in *all* possible worlds,
possible if it is true in *some* possible world, and *contingent* if it
is neither necessary nor impossible.

The above axioms turned out to be valid in modal systems corresponding
to some natural conditions on the relation of modal accessibility or
relative possibility:

Normal systems of modal logic are those in which the laws of logic, such
as *modus ponens*, are assumed to hold. Axiom (**K**), which
characterizes such normal systems, is named after Kripke:

(P → Q) → (P → Q) .

In this chapter we will develop natural deduction systems for
propositional modal logic and set forth the possible world semantics for
them. In a subsequent chapter we’ll set forth these further axioms and
the Provability Logic that enables us to capture the propositional modal
logic structure of Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorems.

# <span class="smallcaps">4. Modal Inference Rules.</span> 

To sentential logic of chapter II, we shall add new rules of inference
to our original stock and state some derived rules that will be
justified later. The new rules are intuitively analogous to rules from
quantifier logic. This parallelism is not accidental since the semantics
for sentential modal logic can be given in terms of quantification over
possible worlds.

The modal sentences at opposite ends of the diagonals of the square are
*contradictories*. These logical relations are captured in the rules of
*modal negation* \[MN\].

> <u>~ϕ</u> <u>~ϕ</u> <u>~ϕ</u> <u>~ϕ</u>
>
> ~ϕ ~ϕ ~ϕ ~ϕ

The modal sentences at the top of the square are not contradictories,
but *contraries*, a sentence cannot be both necessary and impossible,
but it may be neither. A sentence that is neither necessary nor
impossible is *contingent*. Contingency is the opposite of necessity. A
sentence is *contingently true* if it happens to be true but could have
been false, and a sentence is *contingently false* if it happens to be
false but could have been true. The realm of the possible is everything
other than the impossible, and so includes what is contingently true,
contingently false, and necessarily true.

The analogy to quantification also implies corresponding laws of *modal
distribution*:

(P ∧ Q) ↔ (P ∧ Q)

(P ∨ Q) ↔ (P ∨ Q)

The rule of *necessity instantiation* \[NI\] is analogous to an
application of the rule of universal instantiation.[3]

> <u>∀α ϕ</u> <u>ϕ</u>
>
> ϕ ϕ

Here the rule of NI allows us to drop an initial box. Intuitively, this
rule says that whatever is necessary is also the case. The rule of
*Possibility Generalization* \[PG\] is a derived rule analogous to
existential generalization:

> <u>ϕ</u> <u>ϕ</u>
>
> ∃αϕ ϕ

Here the rule of PG allows us to infer ‘ϕ’ from ϕ. Intuitively, this
rule says that whatever is the case is also possibly the case. Note that
PG follows from NI and the third form of MN.

### Exercises

1.  Which of the following inferences come by an application of NI, PG,
    or MN? Briefly explain.

\(A\) <u>(P → Q)</u> <u>(P → Q)</u> <u>P ∧ Q</u> <u>P → Q</u> <u>
P</u>

P → Q P → Q P ∧ Q P → Q P

\(B\) <u>(P → Q)</u> <u>(P → Q)</u> <u>P ∧ Q\_\_</u> <u>P → Q</u>\_\_\_
<u>P\_\_</u>

(P → Q) (P → Q) P ∧Q P → Q P

\(C\) <u>~ (P ∨ Q)</u> <u>~ (P → Q)</u> <u>(P → ~~P)</u> <u>~(P ↔
Q)</u> <u>~ P</u>

 ~ (P ∨ Q) P → Q (P → P) ~ (P ↔Q) ~P

1.  Verify that PG can be derived from NI and the third form of MN.

2.  Using the notion that necessity is truth in *all* possible worlds
    and possibility is truth in *some* possible world, explain the
    analogies between the inference rules and forms of derivation in
    modal logic and the quantifier inference rules UI, EI, EG, and QN
    and the form of derivation UD.

# <span class="smallcaps">5. Natural Deduction for (T), (B), (S4), and (S5).</span> 

In addition to the inference rules NI and MN, we add two form of strict
derivation.

The strict form of derivation known as *necessity derivation* \[ND\]
appears as follows:

*Show* ϕ

χ<sub>1</sub>

.

.

.

χ<sub>m</sub>

where the scope ϕ occurs unboxed among χ<sub>1</sub> through
χ<sub>m.</sub>

In a *necessity derivation* for *Show* ϕ, one derives ϕ using premises
or antecedent lines that are themselves necessary. To ensure that this
form of strict derivation only allows us to derive necessary truths, we
must restrict the lines that may be imported into the strict derivation.

To understand these restrictions, we first supplement the notion of an
*antecedent* line from propositional logic to obtain the notion of an
*accessible* line for modal logic. An *antecedent* *line*, as it is
defined for propositional logic, is a preceding line that is neither
boxed nor contains uncancelled ‘*Show’*. An *accessible line* is defined
as an antecedent line such that there is at most one intervening modal
‘*Show’* line, that is, a ‘*Show’* line of one of the forms

*Show* ϕ

or

*Show* ϕ .

The basic restrictions on for a strict derivation are that none of the
lines χ<sub>1</sub> through χ<sub>n</sub> are (*i*) premises or (*ii*)
comes by an application of an inference rule to an inaccessible line, or
(*iii*) comes by an application of an inference rule other than an
admissible *strict importation rule* to an accessible line.

Next we formulate the *admissible* *strict importation rules* for the
various systems of modal logic. These strict importation rules can be
elegantly formulated as restrictions on the rule of repetition.

-   The characteristic strict importation rule for **T** is NI: when
    importing an accessible sentence of the form ‘ϕ’ into a strict
    derivation, we must drop the initial ‘’.

-   The characteristic strict importation rule for **B** is PG: when
    importing an accessible line into a strict derivation, we must
    prefix a ‘’.

-   The characteristic strict importation rule for **S4** is R: when
    importing an antecedent line into a strict derivation, you may apply
    the rule of repetition R to an accessible line of the form ‘ϕ’.

-   The characteristic strict importation rule for **S5** is R: when
    importing an antecedent line into a strict derivation, you may apply
    the rule of repetition R to an accessible line of the form ‘ϕ’.

Each of the modal systems **B**, **S4**, and **S5** has NI as a strict
importation rule in addition to its characteristic strict importation
rule. In addition, **S5** also has the strict importation rules for
**B** and for **S4**, namely, PG and R. (The annotation for these strict
importation rules will be the line number of the sentence involved and
either ‘NI**’**, ‘PG**’**, ‘R**’**, or ‘R**’**.)

The second form of strict derivation is *possibility derivation*
\[Annotation: PD\]. If we have a ‘*Show’* line of the form

*Show* ϕ ,

and there is some accessible line ψ, then on the next line immediately
after th*e ‘Show’* line one may enter

ψ ,

as an assumption for *possibility derivation* \[Annotation:
Assume(PD)\]. The restrictions for PD are the same as those for the
first form of strict derivation: none of the lines χ<sub>1</sub> through
χ<sub>n</sub> are premises or comes by an application of an inference
rule to an inaccessible line, or comes by an application of an inference
rule other than an admissible strict importation rule to an accessible
line.

Intuitively, *possibility derivation* allows us to Show ψ by deriving ψ
using necessary truths from the assumption that ϕ, where ϕ is an
accessible line. The subsidiary derivation can be thought of as confined
to a particular possible world in which ϕ is assumed to be true. The
intuitive basis for this form of strict derivation is captured by T502:

(P → Q) → (P → Q) ,

which states that whatever is logically entailed by something possible
it itself possible.

The foregoing remarks on derivations constitute only an informal
introduction. The following is an explicit set of directions for
constructing a derivation.

1.  *If ϕ is a symbolic sentence, then*

> *may occur as a line.*

1.  *Any one of the premises may occur as a line.* \[*Annotation:*

2.  *If* ϕ *and* ψ *are symbolic sentences such that*

> *occurs as a line, then* ϕ *may occur as the next line.*
> \[*Annotation:* ‘Assume (CD)’*.*\]

1.  *If ϕ is a symbolic sentence such that*

> *Show* ϕ

A derivation is said to be *complete* if each of its lines is either
boxed or contains cancelled ‘*Show’*. A symbolic sentence ϕ is said to
be *derivable* from given symbolic sentences in *modal system* M if, by
using only clauses (1) - (6) and the strict importation rules for M, a
complete derivation from those premises can be constructed in which

*<s>Show</s>* ϕ

occurs as an unboxed line.

Applications of the above clauses are familiar except for clauses (5),
(6) part (ii), and (7).

We can illustrate clause 6, part (ii), by verifying the claim made above
that *Possibility Generalization* \[PG\] can be derived from Necessity
Instantiation and the third form of Modal Negation.

P ∴ P

1.  *<s>Show</s>* P 3, 5 ID

2.  ~P Assume (ID)

3.  P Premise

4.  ~P 2, MN

5.  ~P 4, NI

An annotated derivation in modal system **T** will illustrate a strict
derivation corresponding to the form of derivation in quantificational
logic known as *universal derivation*. We will construct a derivation
for the (**K**) axiom:

(P → Q) → (P → Q) .

To use the modal premises properly one must be careful to employ the
accompanying strict importation rules associated with the various modal
systems.

1.  *<s>Show</s>* (P → Q) → (P → Q)

2.  (P → Q)

3.  *<s>Show</s>* P → Q

4.  P

5.  *<s>Show</s>* Q

To complete the strict (necessity) derivation began in line 5, we use
two applications of NI, the strict importation rule for **T**, and then
apply MP.

1.  *<s>Show</s>* (P → Q) → (P → Q) 3, CD

2.  (P → Q) Assume (CD)

3.  *<s>Show</s>* P → Q 5, CD

4.  P Assume (CD)

5.  *<s>Show</s>* Q 8, ND

6.  P → Q 2, NI

7.  P 4, NI

8.  Q 6, 7 MP

We may box and cancel line 4 by strict derivation because we have
derived the *scope* of the modal symbolic sentence in line 5 and lines
6 - 8 have only come from accessible lines by the strict importation
rule for **T**.

Intuitively, the first form of strict derivation *necessity derivation*
amounts to showing ‘Q’ by deriving ‘Q’ in an arbitrary possible world in
the box surrounding lines 6 - 8. The restriction on strict derivation
here is that we are only allowed to enter the scope ϕ of accessible
lines of the form ‘ϕ’, that is, the lines entered into the strict
derivation in lines 5-7 are sentences stripped of an initial ‘’. If we
can derive ‘Q’ for this arbitrary possible world, we are justified in
concluding that ‘Q’ holds in all possible worlds.

The second form of strict derivation is *possibility derivation*
\[Annotation: PD\]. The initial ‘*Show’* line is

*Show* ϕ .

With possibility derivation, if ψ occurs as an accessible line, then on
the next line one may enter

ψ

as an assumption for *possibility derivation* \[Annotation: Assume
(PD)\]. The restrictions are the same as those for the first form of
strict derivation: none of the lines χ<sub>1</sub> through χ<sub>n</sub>
are premises or comes by an application of an inference rule to an
inaccessible line, or comes by an application of an inference rule other
than an admissible strict importation rule to an accessible line.
Intuitively, this form of strict derivation allows us to show a sentence
is possibly true by deriving it using necessary truths from a sentence
that is itself possible.

The intuitive basis for PD is modal theorem T502 (P → Q) → (P → Q),
which states that whatever is logically entailed by something possible
it itself possible.

We may prove this theorem T502, which plays a prominent role in modal
ontological arguments, to illustrate PD.

1.  *<s>Show</s>* (P → Q) → (P → Q)

2.  (P → Q) Assume (CD)

3.  *<s>Show</s>* P → Q

4.  P Assume (CD)

5.  *<s>Show</s>* Q

6.  P Assume (PD)

Line 6 comes from ‘P’ in the modally accessible line 4 by possibility
instantiation, which is analogous to existential instantiation in
quantifier logic in which we have the restriction that which we must
instantiate to a variable that is completely new to the derivation.
Here, in contrast to the previous example, the derivation of ‘Q’ is in a
*particular*, rather than an *arbitrary*, possible world, namely, a
world in which ‘P’ is assumed to be true. Therefore, unlike the
necessity derivation in the previous example, since we begin with an
assumption for PD for a *particular* possible world, we are only
justified in concluding ‘Q’ by a strict *possibility* derivation.

1.  *<s>Show</s>* (P → Q) → (P → Q) 3, CD

2.  (P → Q) Assume (CD)

3.  *<s>Show</s>* P → Q 5, CD

4.  P Assume (CD)

5.  *<s>Show</s>* Q 8, PD

6.  P 4, Assume (PD)

7.  P → Q 2, NI

8.  Q 7, 6 MP

Readers are encouraged to check their grasp of the ideas in this example
by annotating and boxing and cancelling the derivation for

(P ∨ Q) ∴ ~P → Q .

1\. *Show* ~P → Q

2\. ~P

3\. ~P

4\. (P ∨ Q)

5\. *Show* Q

6\. (P ∨ Q)

7\. ~P

8\. Q

Next we illustrate the new strict importation rule PG which supplements
the strict importation rule NI in the modal system **B**. We shall
construct a derivation for the Anselmian modal ontological argument
discussed in the introductory section above. Letting ‘G’ abbreviate the
sentence ‘God exists’, we may symbolize the Anselmian argument as
follows:

(G → G) G ∴ G

T570 P → P Axiom (B)

1.  *<s>Show</s>* P → P 3, CD

2.  P Assume (CD)

3.  *<s>Show</s>* P 4, ND

4.  P 2, PG

T571 P → P

T571, the dual form of (**B**), comes from T570 by contraposition and a
generalized modal negation.

1.  *<s>Show</s>* G 11, DD

2.  (G → G) Premise

3.   G Premise

4.  *<s>Show</s>* G 7, PD

5.  G 3, Assume (PD)

6.  G → G 2, NI

7.  G 5, 6 MP

8.  G → G T571

9.  G 4, 8, MP

10. G → G 2, NI

11. G 9, 10 MP

We suggest that the reader test her knowledge of the modal system **B**
by annotating the following version of the above Anselmian argument:

(G → ~~G) . G ∴ G

We shall construct a *B* derivation of the conclusion from its premises.
We begin the derivation indirectly and then enter a critical modal
‘*Show’* line for strict derivation.

1.  *<s>Show</s>* G 5, 12 ID

2.  ~G Assume (ID)

3.  (G → ~~G) Premise

4.  G Premise

5.  *<s>Show</s>* ~~G 8, PD

6.  G 4, Assume (PG)

7.  G → ~~G 3, NI

8.  ~~G 6, 7 MP

9.  *<s>Show</s>* ~~~G 11, ND

10. ~G 2, PG

11. ~ ~~G 10, DN

12. ~~~G 9, MN

To illustrate the strict importation rule for the modal system **S4**,
we construct a derivation for

∴ (P → Q) → (P → Q) .

To show the theorem we assume its antecedent and show its consequent,
which is a modal sentence. To show the consequent, therefore, we
commence a strict derivation. In order to maintain the accessibility of
the initial assumption, which is a necessity, we apply the rule of R
obtain line 4 before entering the next ‘*Show’* line in line 5 for the
scope of modal sentence in line 3.

1.  *Show* (P → Q) → (P → Q)

2.  (P → Q) Assume (CD)

3.  *Show* (P → Q)

4.  (P → Q) 2, R

5.  *Show* P → Q

We then proceed by CD until we reach the consequent, which again, is a
modal sentence.

1.  *Show* (P → Q) → (P → Q)

2.  (P → Q) Assume (CD)

3.  *Show* (P → Q)

4.  (P → Q) 2, R

5.  *Show* P → Q

6.  P Assume (CD)

7.  *Show* Q

We can now complete the derivation by applying NI to lines 4 and 6. Note
that the ‘*Show’* line in 7 is the only intervening modal ‘*Show’* after
line 2 since the ‘*Show’* line in line 5 is for conditional derivation.

1.  *<s>Show</s>* (P → Q) → (P → Q) 3, CD

2.  (P → Q) Assume (CD)

3.  *<s>Show</s>* (P → Q) 5, ND

4.  (P → Q) 2, R

5.  *<s>Show</s>* P → Q 8, CD

6.  P Assume (CD)

7.  (P → Q) 4, R

8.  *<s>Show</s>* Q 11, ND

9.  P → Q 7, NI

10. P 6, NI

11. Q 9, 10 MP

Technically, in applying R we can pass over only one uncancelled modal
‘*Show’* at a time—that is, a ‘*Show’* of the form ‘*Show* ϕ’ or ‘*Show*
ϕ’. Notice, however, with repeated applications of R, we can, in
effect, pass over any number of modal ‘*Show’* lines for strict
derivations.

This follows from the fact that the characteristic axiom for **S4**
allows us to prefix any finite number of ‘’s to a necessary sentence. In
order to eliminate repetitious use of R, we shall allow R to be applied
across *n*-nested strict derivations (annotation R*<sup>n</sup>*). We
may use this short-cut in our previous example,

1.  *<s>Show</s>* (P → Q) → (P → Q) 3, CD

2.  (P → Q) Assume (CD)

3.  *<s>Show</s>* (P → Q) 4, ND

4.  *<s>Show</s>* P → Q 6, CD

5.  P Assume (CD)

6.  *<s>Show</s>* Q 11, ND

7.  (P → Q) 2, R<sup>2</sup>

8.  P 5, NI

9.  P → Q 7, NI

10. Q 9, 8 MP

Intuitively, we may derive necessary truths only from premises which are
themselves necessary. Syntactically, this condition is satisfied if we
require that the lines used to show a necessary statement are themselves
either necessary or follow from necessary statements by the laws of
propositional logic and modal negation. This requirement is met by a
restriction on importation: whenever we import a sentence into a strict
derivation by crossing over an uncancelled ‘*Show*’ for a strict
derivation, we must drop an initial ‘’. When we have a series of nested
strict derivations, we may apply the rule of R across one strict
derivation ‘*Show*’ line at a time, or we may generalize the rule of R
to allow for importation across multiple nested strict derivations as
illustrated above.

Lastly, we wish to construct a derivation in **S5** that illustrates the
strict importation rule R.

Alvin Plantinga’s modal version of an ontological argument is based on
the intuition that God exists if and only if God is the greatest
possible being. If God is the greatest possible being, Plantinga argues,
then God has the greatest form of existence possible, namely, necessary
existence. Using the resources of propositional modal logic, we shall
formulate God’s having necessary existence as the proposition that ‘it
is necessary that God exists’. Then Plantinga’s modal ontological
argument can be stated as follows:

> If it is possible that God exists, then it is possible that it is
> necessary that God exists.
>
> It is possible that God exists. Therefore, God exists.

G → G . G ∴ G .

We shall construct an indirect derivation.

1.  *<s>Show</s>* G

2.  ~G Assume (ID)

3.  G → G Premise

4.  G Premise

5.  G 3, 4 MP

Notice that applying PG to the indirect assumption yields ~G. Since
modalities in **S5** are necessarily true, we may import this modal
statement into a strict derivation by the characteristic strict
importation rule for **S5**, R. This allows us to construct a strict
derivation for ~G, which is, by modal negation, the contradictory of
line 5.

1.  *<s>Show</s>* G 5, 10 ID

2.  ~G Assume (ID)

3.  G → G Premise

4.  G Premise

5.  G 3, 4 MP

6.  ~G 2, PG

7.  *<s>Show</s>* ~G 9, ND

8.  ~G 6, R

9.  ~G 9, MN

> 10\. ~G 7, MN

Now in **S5** we also have all the previous strict importation rules
including NI and PG, and in particular both R and R. Technically, in
applying R and R, we can pass over only one uncancelled modal ‘*Show’*
at a time—that is, a ‘*Show’* of the form ‘*Show* ϕ’ or ‘*Show* ϕ’.
Notice, however, in **S5** we can, in effect, prefix any finite number
of ‘’s to any modal sentence, and so, in effect, pass over any number of
modal ‘*Show’* lines with any modal sentence. In order to eliminate
repetitious uses of R and R, we shall allow R and R to be applied
across *n*-nested strict derivations (annotations R*<sup>n</sup>* and
R*<sup>n</sup>*).

Plantinga’s modal ontological argument uses these strong modal
assumptions of **S5** in which the modal status of any modal proposition
is the same is all possible worlds. Hence, if it is possible that God
exists, then it is necessarily possible that God exists (and, inversely,
if it is possible that God does not exist, then it is impossible that
God exists). Even if Plantinga’s argument is valid (and, indeed, *sound*
if there is *at least one* sound arguments for the existence of God), it
need not be modally persuasive: the way the argument goes—either
theistically or atheistically—depends on the loaded possibility premise.

These derivations in the various modal systems can be tedious due to the
various restrictions. We can make the modal natural deduction system
less restricted by proving modal theorems. It is particularly useful to
generalize MN for a string of modal operators, and to be able to employ
the rule of Interchange of Equivalence using previously proven
biconditional theorems. Modal theorems for the various modal systems are
listed in a subsequent section. However, first, we shall explain why the
various restrictions as set forth in the formal characterization of a
modal derivation are required.

### Exercises

In constructing modal derivations, the following strategic hints may be
useful.

*Hint 1. After entering the ‘Show’ line for the conclusion and taking
any useful assumptions, enter the premises.*

*Hint 2. If your initial ‘Show’ line is a modal statement, you may need
to reenter the ‘Show’ line to commence a strict derivation.*

*Hint 3. To show a sentence of the form* ‘ϕ’*, use strict derivation in
the form of a necessity derivation, that is derive* ϕ *from other
necessary truths.*

*Hint4. To show a sentence of the form ‘*ϕ*’, use strict derivation in
the form of possibility derivation, i.e., judiciously choose from the
accessible lines of the form* ‘ψ’ *to get an assumption for possibility
derivation that will enable you to derive* ϕ*.*

*Hint 5. If you have an iterated modal statement as an accessible line,
you may need to get a contradiction for indirect derivation by modal
negation.*

6\. In this exercise, we construct modal derivations of the following
Anselmian modal arguments. For the purpose of this exercise, we allow
ourselves to use the letter ‘G’ for the proposition ‘God exists.’

\(A\) Construct a **T**-derivation for the following argument**:**

> It is necessary that if God exists then it is necessary that God
> exists. It is possible that God does not exist. Therefore, God does
> not exist.

\(B\) Construct a **B**-derivation for the following argument:

> *“No one...doubts that if it \[that than which a greater cannot be
> thought\] did exist, its nonexistence, either in actuality or in the
> understanding, would be impossible. For otherwise it would not be that
> than which a greater cannot be thought.”*

(G → ~~G)

> *“Therefore, if that than which a greater cannot be thought can even
> be thought, it cannot be nonexistent.”*

∴ G → G

\(C\) Construct an **S4**-derivation for the following argument taken
from Anselm’s *Reply to Gaunilo* where he writes: *“But as to whatever
can be conceived, but does not exist—if there were such a being, its
non-existence, either in reality or in the understanding, would be
possible.”*

This first premise is actually a schema since Anselm substitutes for the
statement denying that God has existence, statements denying that God
has various perfections:

(G ∧ ~G → ~P)

If, however, God is a being than which none greater can be conceived,
then God necessarily has all perfections. Hence, we have as a second
premise:

P .

From these two premises, derive that it is necessary that if God’s
existence is possible then God exists:

(G → G) .

\(D\) Taking the conclusion of exercise (C) as a premise, namely ‘(G →
G)’, construct an **S5**-derivation for the conclusion that it is
necessary that God exists if it is possible that God exists:

G → G .

\(E\) Construct an **S5**-derivation for the argument:

> It is necessary that if God exists then it is necessary that God
> exists. It is possible that God exists. Therefore, it is necessary
> that God exists.

# 6. <span class="smallcaps">Fallacies</span>. 

In the directions for constructing a modal derivation, a number of
restrictions appear whose significance is not perhaps immediately
obvious. Recall that a *fallacy* is a procedure that permits the
validation of a *false English argument*, that is, an argument whose
premises are true sentences of English and whose conclusion is a false
sentence of English (or at least are regarded so for the sake of
argument). Here we show that the neglect of the various new restrictions
on modal derivation would lead to fallacies.

Consider the following argument:

> If Descartes is thinking, then Descartes exists. Descartes is
> thinking. Therefore, it is necessary that Descartes exists.

Descartes is a continent being and so the conclusion of the argument is
false. Let us take it for granted that Descartes exists if he is
thinking and even that Descartes is thinking. It does not follow from
these premises that it is necessary that Descartes exists.

P → Q . P ∴ Q

Where is the fallacy in the following attempted derivation?

1\. *<s>Show</s>* Q 4, ND

2\. P → Q Premise

3\. P Premise

4\. Q 2, 3 MP

The fallacy occurs in line 1, where one attempts to box and cancel by
strict derivation. One of the restrictions on strict derivation is that
premises cannot be among the lines that are boxed. Intuitively, premises
are true in the actual world but may not be true in every possible
world, and therefore, cannot enter into strict derivations.

Consider the argument:

> Roses could be green, but they aren’t. Therefore, is possible that the
> moon is made of green cheese.

P ∧ ~P ∴ Q

Here the premise does not assert an actual contradiction. Instead the
premise asserts that it is contingently false that roses are green. The
conclusion asserts something that is not only false but clearly
irrelevant to the premises. Where is the fallacy in the following
attempted derivation?

1\. *<s>Show</s>* Q 6, PD

2\. P ∧ ~P Premise

3\. P 2, S

4\. *<s>Show</s>* P → ~P 5, CD

5\. ~P 2, S

6\. *<s>Show</s>* Q 7, PD

7\. *<s>Show</s>* Q 8, 9 ID

8\. P 3, Assume (PD)

9\. ~P 8, 4 MP

An assumption for possibility derivation can only occur immediately
after a sentence of the form ‘*Show* ◊ϕ’. Therefore a fallacy occurs in
line 8. Moreover, one cannot box and cancel by indirect derivation if
the derivation begins with an assumption for possibility derivation.
Consequently, a fallacy also occurs in line 7 when one attempts to box
and cancel by indirect derivation.

The following argument is clearly invalid. In fact, assuming it is only
contingently true that roses are red, it is a *false* English argument
because its premise would be true while the conclusion is false.

Roses are red and violets are blue. Therefore, it is necessary that
roses are red.

Where is the fallacy in the following attempted derivation?

P ∧ Q ∴ P

1\. *<s>Show</s>* P 3, DD

2\. P ∧ Q Premise

3\. *<s>Show</s>* P 4, ND

4\. P 2, S

One of the restrictions on strict derivation is that inference rules
cannot be applied to inaccessible lines. In this example, the premise in
line 2 is not accessible from line 4. The rule of simplification cannot
be applied to line 2 to obtain line 4 in the strict derivation. This
line prohibits the boxing and cancelling in line 3. Intuitively,
premises are true in the actual world but may not be true in every
possible world.

The following English argument is not only invalid but false, assuming
that the premise is a true future contingent proposition.

The sea battle will happen. Therefore, it is necessary that the sea
battle will happen.

P ∴ P

Where is the fallacy in the following attempted derivation?

1.  *<s>Show</s>* P 4, DD

2.  P Premise

3.  P 2, PG

4.  *<s>Show</s>* P 5, ND

5.  P 3, Assume (PD)

Here the assumption for possibility derivation in line 5 is incorrect.
Such an assumption must occur immediately after a ‘*Show’* line of the
form ‘*Show* ◊ϕ’, whereas in this case, the ‘*Show’* line is of the form
‘ϕ’, a necessary statement. Furthermore, one may not box and cancel by
strict derivation in line 4 even though we have obtained the scope of
the sentence in the ‘*Show’* line 4, namely, P, in line 5. The reason is
not that line 5 is a premise, or comes by an application of an inference
rule to an inaccessible line, but because it was *obtained by a means
other than an admissible strict importation rule to an accessible
antecedent line.*

Consider the following two arguments. The first is intuitively valid:

> It is possible that Schödinger’s cat is dead, or it is possible that
> Schrödinger’s cat is alive.
>
> Therefore, it is possible that Schrödinger’s cat is dead or alive.

Conversely, the following argument is also intuitively valid:

> It is possible that Schrödinger’s cat is dead or alive. Therefore, it
> is possible that Schödinger’s cat is dead, *o*r it is possible that
> Schrödinger’s cat is alive.

However, the argument obtained by *conjoining* the two separate
possibility statements under a single possibility operator is clearly
invalid:

> It is possible that Schrödinger’s cat is dead. It is possible
> Schrödinger’s cat is alive.
>
> Therefore, it is possible that Schrödinger’s cat is both dead *and*
> alive.

P . Q ∴ (P ∧ Q)

Where is the fallacy in the following attempted derivation?

1\. *<s>Show</s>* (P ∧ Q) 4, DD

2\.  Premise

3\. Q Premise

4\. *<s>Show</s>* P ∧ Q) 7, PD

5\. P 2, Assume (PD)

6\. Q 3, Assume (PD)

7\. P ∧ Q 5, 6 ADJ

The restriction on entering as assumption for possibility derivation
states that such an assumption must occur *immediately after* the
uncancelled ‘*Show*’ line. Line 5 is legitimate since occurs immediately
after line 4, which is of the form ‘*Show* ϕ’. However, line 6, the
second application of entering as assumption for PD is fallacious since
it does not occur immediately after the uncancelled ‘*Show’* line 4.

Consider next the following more intricate fallacious argument which is
a variation on Ivan’s famous argument in *The Brother Karamazov*.

> If God is dead, then everything is permitted. It is possible that God
> is dead.
>
> Therefore, it is possible that everything is permitted.

P → Q . P ∴ Q

Where is the fallacy in the following attempted derivation?

1\. *<s>Show</s>* Q 4, DD

2\. P → Q Premise

3\. P Premise

4\. *<s>Show</s>* Q 6, PD

5\. P 3, Assume (PD)

6\. Q 2, 5 MP

Here the fallacy occurs in line 4 in the attempt to box and cancel by
strict derivation. In a strict derivation, none of the boxed lines may
come from an application of an inference rule to an inaccessible line,
or by an application of an inference rule other than an admissible
strict importation rule to an accessible line. Notice that line 6 comes
from an application of an inference rules to the premise in line 2 and
so violates the above restriction.

Sometimes when we say that P is possible, what we mean is not that P is
*metaphysically* possible, but only that “for all we know” P is the
case. This is an *epistemic* interpretation of possibility. In 1637
Fermat read Diophantus’ *Arithmetic*, a 3<sup>rd</sup> century treatise
and noted in the margins “dividing a cube into two cubes, or in general
an *n*th power of two *n*th powers, is impossible if *n* is larger than
2. I have found a remarkable proof of this fact, but the margin is too
narrow to contain it.” This enigmatic remark led to the centuries of
mathematicians trying to prove “Fermat’s Last Theorem”. The status of
Fermat’s conjecture was not established until 1995 when Andrew Wiles,
together with his graduate student Richard Taylor, published a proof of
Fermat’s Last Theorem.

Now consider the following English argument (given before 1995):

> It is possible (*for all we know*) that Fermat’s Last Theorem is a
> theorem (and hence, necessarily true). Therefore, if it is possible
> (*for all we know*) that Fermat was right in believing he had a proof
> of his theorem, then Fermat’s Last Theorem is a true.

P ∴ Q → P

(Here it could be argued that the premise is not properly symbolized
because it mixes metaphysical and epistemic modalities.) Where is the
fallacy in tehe following attempted derivation?

1\. *<s>Show</s>* Q → P 3, DD

2\. P Premise

3\. *<s>Show</s>* Q → P 5, CD

4\. P 2, Assume (PD)

5\. P 4, NI

One may enter an assumption for possibility derivation only after a
‘*Show’* line of the form ‘*Show* ϕ’. However, the sentence in line 3 is
conditional, not a modal sentence. One may enter an assumption for
possibility derivation only after a ‘*Show’* line of the form ‘*Show*
ϕ’. Therefore, a fallacy occurs in line 4. It happens that if we
interpret the modal operators as uniformly metaphysically and assume the
modal system **S5**, then we can construct a derivation of the
conclusion from the premise. The verification of this claim is left as
an exercise for the reader.

Consider one final intuitively fallacious English argument. Let’s
suppose that the universe is “fine-tuned”, namely, that it is physically
impossible for this universe to exist and for the fundamental constants
of physics to be other than they actually are. We could ask the further
speculative question of whether this universe could have existed if it
operated according to a different system of physical laws together with
a different set of constants. Suppose the answer to this question is
‘yes’. Then the following argument is intuitively fallacious:

It is possible that it is possible that the laws of physics could have
been different than they are.

Therefore, the law of physics could have been different than they are.

One way to symbolize this argument is as follows:

P ∴ P

Can you identify the fallacy in the following attempted derivation?

1\. *<s>Show</s>* P 3, DD

2\. P Premise

3\. *<s>Show</s>*  4, DD

4\. P 2, Assume (PD)

One cannot box and cancel the direct derivation in line 3 because line 4
was introduced by an assumption for possibility derivation. One of the
new restrictions on a direct derivation for ‘*Show* ϕ’ in modal
propositional logic is that ϕ occurs unboxed among subsequent lines
χ<sub>1</sub> through χ<sub>*n*</sub> and χ<sub>1</sub> but was *not
introduced by an assumption for Possibility Derivation*. Therefore, a
fallacy occurs in the boxing and cancelling of line 3. It turns out,
however, that this argument can be validated in **S4**. The verification
of this claim is left as an exercise for the reader.

The above examples justify, in part, the new restrictions set forth in
our official syntactical characterization of the natural deduction
systems for modal propositional logic. In the next section, we shall see
how these restrictions—in particular, the rules of strict
importation—are related to the characteristic axioms of the various
modal systems. The reason for these *syntactical* restrictions on
derivations can be more clearly understood in light of the *semantics*
for propositional modal logic, which we set forth in the next section.

# <span class="smallcaps">7. Possible World Semantics.</span> 

The Leibnizian idea of characterizing necessity and possibility in terms
of truth in all or some possible worlds was given an elegant
formalization by Saul Kripke (1959, 1963) when he was only a teenager.
According to Leibniz, a sentence is *necessary* if it is true in *every*
possible world, and a sentence is *possible* if it is true is *some*
possible world. Kripke showed that by placing very natural conditions on
a relation of *relatively possibility* or *accessibility* on a set of
possible world, the various systems of modal logic could be validated.

Intuitively, a possible world tells us for each sentence letter whether
it is true or false in that world. Stripping away inessentials, we can
represent a possible world by a subset of sentence letters. A *modal
structure* **M** is an ordered triple &lt;*W*, R, α&gt;, where *W* is a
set of possible worlds, R is a relation on *W* x *W* known as the
*accessibility relation* or the *relative possibility relation*, and α
is a distinguished element of *W* known as the *actual world*.

We can exhaustively characterize the notion of the *truth of a sentence
in a possible world ββ*

⊨ <sub>β</sub> ϕ .

\(1\) If ϕ is a sentence letter S, then

⊨<sub>β</sub> S ⇔ S ∈ β (i.e., S is a member of β) .

\(2\) If ϕ is a ~ψ, then

⊨<sub>β</sub> ~ψ ⇔ ⊭ <sub>β</sub> ψ (i.e., not ⊨<sub>β</sub> ψ) .

\(3\) If ϕ is (ψ ∧ χ), then

⊨<sub>β</sub> (ψ ∧ χ) ⇔ ⊨<sub>β</sub> ψ & ⊨<sub>β</sub> χ .

If ϕ is (ψ ∨ χ), then

⊨<sub>β</sub> (ψ ∨ χ) ⇔ (⊨<sub>β</sub> ψ **∨** ⊨ <sub>β</sub> χ ) (i.e.,
**∨** is the inclusive ‘*or’* in the metalanguage) .

If ϕ is (ψ → χ), then

⊨<sub>β</sub> (ψ → χ) ⇔ (⊨<sub>β</sub> ψ ⇒ ⊨<sub>β</sub> χ) (i.e., if
⊨<sub>β</sub> ψ then ⊨<sub>β</sub> χ , or either ⊭<sub>β</sub> ψ or
⊨<sub>β</sub> χ) .

If ϕ is (ψ ↔ χ), then

⊨<sub>β</sub> (ψ ↔ χ) ⇔ (⊨<sub>β</sub> ψ ⇔ ⊨<sub>β</sub> χ) (i.e.,
either both ⊨<sub>β</sub> ψ & ⊨<sub>β</sub> χ or both ⊭<sub>β</sub> ψ &
⊭<sub>β</sub> χ) .

Finally, the law clause gives the Leibnizian truth conditions for
necessity and possibility:

1.  If ϕ is ψ, then

2.  

⊨<sub>β</sub> ψ ⇔ ∀γ ∈ W(Rβγ ⇒ ⊨<sub>γ</sub> ψ) (i.e., ψ is true in
*all* possible worlds γ possible relative to β) .

If ϕ is ψ, then

⊨<sub>β</sub> ψ ⇔ ∃γ ∈ W(Rβγ & ⊨<sub>γ</sub> ψ) (i.e., ψ is true in
*some* possible world γ possible relative to β) .

This completes the definition of truth in a model for modal
propositional logic. Using this definition of truth, we can now defined
what it means for a sentence to be *semantic valid.*

⊨ ϕ (i.e., ϕ is *semantically valid*) if and only if ∀α ∈ W,
⊨<sub>α</sub> ϕ .

Next we obtain different systems of modal logic when various conditions
are placed on the accessibility or relative possibility relation R. We
say that a relation R is a *series* if R is serial. R is a *reflexivity*
if R is reflexive. R is a *similarity* if R is reflexive and symmetric.
R is a *partial ordering* if R is reflexive and transitive. R is an
*equivalence relation* if R is reflexive and euclidean. It turns out
that the axioms of modal logic discussed above are validated when
natural conditions are imposed on the accessibility or relative
possibility relation R.

Systems of modal logic are *normal* when everything derivable from
necessary truths are themselves necessary. This will be the case if the
rule of *modus ponens* and axiom **K** (named after Kripke) are valid:

(ϕ → ψ) → (ϕ → ψ) .

Axiom **K** expresses the intuition that *necessary truths imply only
necessary truths*.

We can conveniently summarize the above systems of modal logic in a
chart. The various modal systems can be characterized by the axioms that
are valid in them. The smallest normal modal logic system **K** contains
axiom **K**. The four most famous modal logics are system (T) named
after the Gödel-Feyes-von Wright modal logic to model tautologies,
system **S4** and **S5**, named after C. I. Lewis’s axioms for strict
implication, and the unduly neglected Brouwersche system **B,** named by
Becker after the intuitionist L. E. J. Brouwer due to the characteristic
axiom’s similarity to intuitionistic double negation. All these systems
contain **K** and **T**. The system (D) which is weaker system than
(**T**), containing axioms K and **D**, is named for deontic logic.

Notice that relationships of containment among the modal systems follow
from the logic of relations. Axiom **B** requires that R be symmetric
and **4** requires that R be transitive. System **S5** with axioms **T**
and **E** require R be an equivalence relation (i.e., reflexive,
symmetric, and transitive); hence, **S5** could also be specified by
requiring axioms **T**, **4**, and **B** to be valid. Therefore, **S5**
contains **S4** and **B**, neither of which contains the other. Systems
**S5**, **S4** and **B** all contain system **T**, which contains **D**.

A convenient way of describing these modal logics is by their *Lemmon
code* listing the axioms valid in them. For example, **S5** = **KTE** =
**KT4B** = **KD4B**. We can represent these containment relations in a
diagram in which downward paths represent containment.

One way to visualize how the conditions on the accessibility relation
validate their respective axioms is use the definitions of ‘’ and ‘’ in
terms of possible worlds and use directed graphs from chapter IV to
represent the accessibility relation R. Here the accessibility relation
Rαβ (read “β is possible relative to α” or “β is accessible to α”) is
represented by an arrow from a circle representing possible world α to a
circle representing possible world β.

> Rαβ

α β

<span class="smallcaps">Figure 9 Accessibility Represented by Directed
Graphs</span>

We can, using the directed graphs from the theory of relations,
translate properties of accessibility relations into geometric
properties of directed graphs. Symmetry, for example, requires that all
accessibility arrows are double arrows. Reflexivity requires that every
world be accessible to itself and so every world has a loop, a special
case of a double arrow. Seriality requires that every world is a tail of
an arrow. Transitivity requires that for every indirect path has a
shortcut. Being euclidean and serial is tantamount to being an
equivalence relation, that is, to being reflexive, symmetric and
transitive. Expressing R in terms of love and worlds in terms of
persons, we have the following intuitive translations:

Using the definition of truth in a modal system set forth above, we can
rigorously demonstrate that if R is transitive, then axiom **4** is
valid. This demonstration is carried out in the meta-language. We use
the use the symbols ‘∀’, ‘∃’, ‘&’, ‘**∨’,** ‘⇒’, ‘’⇔’, and ‘∈’ in the
meta-language for ‘*all’*, ‘*some’*, ‘*and’*, ‘*or’* ‘*if… then’*, ‘*if
and only if’* and ‘*is an element of’*, respectively. Once the truth
clauses are unpacked, the logical demonstration is no more complicated
than a derivation in the theory of relations.

We can show that imposing transitivity on R implies the validity of the
(**4**) axiom as follows:

1.  *<s>Show</s>* R is *transitive* ⇒ ⊨ (ϕ → ϕ) 3, CD

2.  ∀α∀β∀γ(Rαβ & Rβγ ⇒ Rαγ) Assume (CD), Def. *transitive*

3.  *<s>Show</s>* ⊨ (ϕ → ϕ) 24, DD

4.  *<s>Show</s>* ∀α ∈ *W* (⊨<sub>α</sub> ϕ ⇒ ⊨<sub>α</sub> ϕ) 5, UD

5.  *<s>Show</s>* ⊨<sub>α</sub> ϕ ⇒ ⊨<sub>α</sub> ϕ 7, CD

6.  ⊨<sub>α</sub> ϕ Assume (CD)

7.  ∀β ∈*W* (Rαβ ⇒ ⊨<sub>β</sub> ϕ) 6, Truth-Def.

8.  *<s>Show</s>* ⊨<sub>α</sub> ϕ 23, DD

9.  *<s>Show</s>* ∀β∈*W* (Rαβ ⇒ ⊨<sub>β</sub> ϕ) 10, UD

10. *<s>Show</s>* Rαβ ⇒ ⊨<sub>β</sub> ϕ 12, CD

11. Rαβ Assume (CD)

12. *<s>Show</s>* ⊨ <sub>β</sub> ϕ 22, DD

13. *<s>Show</s>* ∀γ ∈ *W* (Rβγ ⇒ ⊨<sub>γ</sub> ϕ) 14, UD

14. *<s>Show</s>* Rβγ ⇒ ⊨<sub>γ</sub> ϕ 16, CD

15. Rβγ Assume (CD)

16. *<s>Show</s>* ⊨<sub>γ</sub> ϕ 22, DD

17. Rαβ & Rβγ 11, 15 ADJ

18. Rαβ & Rβγ ⇒ Rαγ 2, UI<sup>3</sup>

19. Rαγ 18, 17 MP

20. Rαγ ⇒ ⊨<sub>γ</sub> ϕ 7, UI

21. ⊨<sub>γ</sub> ϕ 20, 19 MP

22. ⊨<sub>β</sub> ϕ 12, Truth-Def.

23. ⊨<sub>α</sub> ϕ 8, Truth-Def.

24. ⊨ (ϕ → ϕ) 4, Def. ⊨

We can show that the above implication holds using semantic diagrams. We
will show that if

ϕ → ϕ

is invalid, then the accessibility relation cannot be transitive.
Assuming that the above axiom fails, then its antecedent ‘ϕ’ is true but
its consequent ‘ ϕ’ is false in α.

ϕ

~ ϕ

So by a generalized form of modal negation, the latter is equivalent to

 ~ϕ .

So both ‘ϕ’ and ‘~ϕ’ are true in some possible world α. By the
definition of the truth for , we have that ~ϕ is true in some world β
accessible to α. Applying the definition of truth for  again, we have
that for some world γ accessible to β, ~ϕ is true in γ. By the
definition of the truth for , since we have that ϕ is true in α, ϕ must
be true in all worlds accessible from α including β. Can γ be accessible
to α? No, because ~ϕ is true in γ, and since ϕ is true in α and so ϕ
must be true in all worlds accessible to α. Can R be transitive? There
is an indirect path from α to β and from β to γ, therefore, if R were
transitive, there would have to be a shortcut from α to γ. However, we
have already seen that γ cannot be accessible to α. Therefore, if axiom
**4** fails to be valid, then the accessibility relation R cannot be
transitive. By contraposition, if the accessibility relation R is
required to be transitive, then axiom **4** is valid.

1.  There are different axiomatizations for different philosophical
    conception of time. According to the *tensed theory of time*
    championed by the philosopher C. D. Broad, the past is real and the
    present moves up the tree of possible futures turning the unreal
    future into the real past. Another theory, due to A. N. Prior, known
    as *presentism*, holds that only the present is real and the past
    and the future are unreal. What do the following axioms express
    about the structure of time?

> \(A\) (ϕ → ψ) → (ϕ → ψ); (ϕ → ψ) → (ϕ → ψ)
>
> \(B\) ϕ → ϕ; ϕ → ϕ
>
> \(C\) ϕ → ϕ; ϕ → ϕ \[*Hint*: see exercise 4 below for
> **4<sup>C</sup>**.\]
>
> \(D\) ϕ → ϕ; ϕ → ϕ \[*Hint*: *seriality* toward the future implies
> there is no last moment of time\].
>
> \(E\) ϕ → ϕ; ϕ → ϕ \[*Hint*: these are the *interaction* theorems.\]

3\. Prior’s axiomatization of temporal logic known as the *Diodorean
System* consists of **KT4** and the following axiom **Dum** (named after
the philosopher Michael Dummett, a champion of intuitionism). Give a
reading of his axiom in temporal logic:

> ((P→ P) → P)→ (P → P) .

4\. Demonstrate that the following axioms require the corresponding
conditions on R.

</tbody>
</table>

Formulate each of the conditions on R in terms of a directed graph. Then
demonstrate that if each of the axioms is assumed to be invalid, then
the corresponding condition on R must fails to hold.

5\. An elegant result due to Lemmon and Scott (1977) states a
correspondence between conditions on R and axioms of the generalized
form:

*<sup>hi</sup>*ϕ → *<sup>j</sup>**<sup>k</sup>*ϕ .

Here *<sup>m</sup>* and *<sup>n</sup>* represents *m* diamonds and *n*
boxes in a row, respectively. The corresponding condition on R imposed
by the generalized axiom is given by

R*<sup>h</sup>*αβ & R*<sup>j</sup>*αγ ⇒ ∃η(R*<sup>i</sup>*βη &
R*<sup>k</sup>*γη) .

Here the *composition* R ° S of two relations R and S (in symbols, R °
S) can be defined as

R ° S αβ =<sub>df</sub> ∃γ(Rαγ & Sγβ) .

For example, if R is the relation *being a sister of* and S is the
relation *being a parent of*, then the composition of the relations R
<sub>°</sub> S is the relation *being* *an aunt of*, that is

R ° S αβ ↔ ∃γ(Rαγ & Sγβ) .

If R is the relation *being a parent of*, then R <sub>°</sub> R = R
<sup>2</sup> is the relation *being a grandparent of*, and R
<sub>°</sub> R <sub>°</sub> R = R<sup>3</sup> is the relation *being a
great-grandparent of*. R <sup>0</sup> is the *identity relation*, i.e.,
R<sup>0</sup>αβ if and only if α = β, and R <sup>1</sup> = R.

Verify that the values for *h, i, j, k* as indicated in the chart yield
the standard axioms, and that the standard condition on R for each of
the axioms is equivalent to the one specified by the Lemmon-Scott
Generalized Correspondence theorem:

5\. Another interpretation of the ‘’ is provability. The *Gödel-Löb
Provability System* is the system **K4W,** where the **(W)** axiom (here
‘W’ stands for “well-ordering”) is as follows:

(**GL**) (ϕ → ϕ) → ϕ .

Give an informal argument to show that (**GL**) requires the
accessibility relation to be transitive, irreflexive, and *finite*
(i.e., indirect paths of R chains terminate in a *finite* number of
steps.) It is interesting to note that being ‘finite’ cannot be
expressed in a sentence of first-order logic. This follows from the
compactness meta-theorem that states that any infinite set of sentences
that is finitely satisfiable (i.e., any finite subset has a model) must
also be satisfiable (i.e., there is a model that satisfies the entire
infinite set).

Recall that an argument is *semantically valid* if and only if its
logical form is such that it is impossible for its premises to be true
while its conclusion is false. Conditional arguments occur with enough
frequency to have acquired traditional names for its valid, and
fallacious, inferences.

Notice that row 3 of the truth table for the conditional must be T if
the fallacies of affirming the consequent or denying the antecedent are
invalid. By the definition of invalidity, it must be possible for the
following argument to have true premises and a false conclusion (steps
1-3 and 3’). However, given that a negation must have the opposite value
of the sentence it negative, P must be **F** (step 4 and 4’).

Therefore, if the argument is to be invalidated, the conditional must be
true when its antecedent is **T** and its consequent is **F**. The value
of the conditional in row 3 must therefore be **T**.

Next we note that we must be able to distinguish a *conditional* (P → Q)
from its *converse* (Q → P). Therefore, the value of the second row of
the truth table for the conditional must be *different* from its value
in the third row. The value of the conditional in row 2 must therefore
be **F**.

Beside the common fallacies noted above, there are some uncommon, or
deviant, fallacies, which we shall call *modus tortoise* *ponens*, and
*modus tortoise tollens*.

To invalidate *modus tortoise ponens*, row 1 of the truth table for the
conditional must be T, and to invalidate *modus tortoise tollens*, row 4
of the truth table for the conditional must also be T.

Given this standard truth-functional definition of the conditional,
other validities also follow. Some of these have a paradoxical quality
if the conditional is interpreted “implies” and so these are known as
the *paradoxes of material implication*.

One of the most puzzling validities is known as *Lewis’s Dilemma*:

P ∧ ~P → Q ,

which states *“a contradiction implies anything”*. This implication
follows from the inference rules of simplification, addition, and *modus
tollendo ponens*, which are themselves not particularly puzzling.

1\. *<s>Show</s>* P ∧ ~P → Q 6, CD

2\. P ∧ ~P Assume (CD)

3\. P 2, S

4\. ~P 2, S

5\. P ∨ Q 3, ADD

6\. Q 5, 4 MTP

Therefore, the justification for the truth table for the conditional,
the definition of semantic validity, and the derivation of other
theorems using conditional derivation and standard rules of inference
are all interconnected. To question one of these elements requires
revisions of all the other concepts to form a coherent whole.

The following theorems (and tautologies) are known as the paradoxes of
material implications because of their variance from the natural
language uses of the conditional.

<span class="mark">T18 ~P → (P → Q) False Antecedent—*“whenever ~P, P
implies Q”*</span>

<span class="mark">T2 Q → (P → Q) True Consequent—*“whenever Q, P
implies Q”*</span>

<span class="mark">T58 (P → Q) ∨ (Q → R) Conditional Excluded Middle—*“Q
is either an antecedent or consequent”*</span>

<span class="mark">T114 (~P → P) ↔ P *Consequentia Mirabilis—“P is
equivalent to ~P implies P”*</span>

<span class="mark"> P ∧ ~P → Q Lewis’s Dilemma—*“a contradiction implies
anything”*</span>

C. I. Lewis investigated modal logic in order to find a
conditional—strict implication—which did not result in these paradoxes.
Lewis defined strict implication P ⇒ Q (read “P *strictly implies* Q”)
by combining modality with the truth-functional conditional:

P ⇒ Q := (P ∧ ~Q) ,

or alternatively,

P ⇒ Q := (P → Q) .

Lewis then added axioms such as axiom **4** and axiom **5** to
characterize different implication relations.

Nevertheless, strict implication inherited some of the paradoxical
qualities of the material implication.

T551 ~P → (P → Q) *an impossible antecedent implies anything*

T550 Q → (P → Q) *a necessary consequent is implied by anything*

T552 (P → Q) ∨ (Q → P) *every proposition is either the consequent of a
possible conditional or*

*the antecedent of a necessary conditional*

The *counterfactual conditional* (or subjunctive condition) states what
would be the case if its antecedent were true (although it is not true).
In contrast, the material (or indicative) conditional indicates what is
(in fact) the case if its antecedent is (in fact) true (which may or may
not be true).

The difference between *indicative* and *subjective* conditionals can be
illustrated:

\(1\) If Oswald *did* not shoot Kennedy, then someone else *did*.
Indicative conditional

\(2\) If Oswald *had* not shot Kennedy, then someone else *would*
*have*. Subjunctive conditional

In the first sentence, the antecedent may or may not be true, and the
consequent may or may not be true, but what the speaker asserts (in the
past tense *indicative* mood) is what would have had to have been the
case if the antecedent were in fact true. It is a conditional statement
about the actual past.

In the second sentence, the speaker takes it for granted that the
antecedent (formulated in the past perfect subjunctive, or what is
called the *pluperfect* subjunctive, mood) is contrary to fact and
asserts what would have been the case if under that supposition.

Neither the truth-functional conditional nor the strict conditional
represents the logic of the counterfactual conditional. The antecedents
of counterfactuals are false, but that does not make them all true, as
in the case of the material conditional. Neither are counterfactual
conditionals strict conditionals.

> *Strengthening*: P ⇒ Q ∴ P ∧ R ⇒ Q
>
> *Transitivity*: P ⇒ Q . Q ⇒ R ∴ P ⇒ R

Counterexample to Strengthening the Antecedent:

1\. If the Nazis had succeeded in constructing an atomic bomb before the
U.S., Germany would have won WWII.

2\. If the Nazis had succeeded in constructing an atomic bomb before the
U.S. and had accidentally detonated it in Berlin, then Germany would
have won WWII.

Counterexample to Transitivity:

1\. If George W. Bush had been born in Afghanistan, then he would have
been a member of Al-Qaeda.

2\. If George W. Bush had been a member of Al-Qaeda, then he would have
been leaking U. S. defense secrets to Al-Qaeda prior to 9-11.

3\. So, if George W. Bush has been born in Afghanistan, then he would
have been leaking U. S. defense secrets to Al-Qaeda prior to 9-11.

Why does transitivity fail for counterfactuals? The antecedents of the
counterfactuals don’t relate to the same states of affairs. The first
premise has to do with states of affairs (or possible worlds) in
which--other things being as close as possible to the actual world—GWB
was born in Afghanistan. The second premise, however, has to do with
states of affairs (or possible worlds) in which--other things being as
close as possible to the actual world—in which GWB as President of the
U. S. was secretly an Al-Qaeda operative. The states of affairs that the
first premise has to do with need not coincide with those of the second:
if GWB had been born in Afghanistan, he wouldn't be President of the U.
S. and so presumably wouldn't have access to U. S. defense secrets.

1\. The counterfactual ‘*would’* and ‘*might’*.

P → Q If P had been the case, then Q *would* have been the case.

P → Q If P had been the case, then Q *might* have been the case.

Negation of a Stalnaker Counterfactual \[NSCF\]:

~(ϕ → ψ) ∴ ϕ → ~ψ

Stalnaker Counterfactual Excluded Middle: (ϕ → ψ) ∨ (ϕ → ~ψ)

Lewis’s “*Might*” Counterfactual: (ϕ → ψ) := ~(ϕ → ~ψ)

Notice that given the Stalnaker Counterfactual Excluded Middle, Lewis’s
definition of “*might*” would collapse “*would*” and “*might*”
counterfactuals.

How can Stalnaker define the “*might*” counterfactuals in terms of the
“*would*” counterfactual?

P → Q := (P → Q)

P → Q is true in a world α iff Q is true is *all* the worlds that make P
true and are closest to Q.

P → Q is true in a world α iff Q is true is *at least one* of the
worlds that make P true and are closest to Q.

# <span class="smallcaps">10. Modal Provability Systems of Gödel and Löb.</span> 

Soon after publishing his famous Incompleteness Theorems in 1931, Gödel
wrote a short note on the embedding intuitionistic logic in modal logic
entitled “An interpretation of intuitionistic propositional calculus
\[1933f\].” What was Gödel’s central insight? Intuitionistic *truth* is
characterized in terms of *proof*. Now since *provability* is a kind of
*necessity*, modal logic be used in the investigation of the logic of
provability.

Gödel’s idea is to interpret Heyting’s intuitionistic propositional
calculus using classical propositional calculus supplemented with the
modal notion “*p* is provable”, which he symbolized “B*p*” (for
*beweisbar*). Gödel gave a particularly perspicuous axiomatization.
Gödel’s three proposed axioms (in an equivalent form with now standard
code letter) are as follows:

(**T**) B*p* → *p*

(**K**) B(*p* → *q*) → (B*p* → B*q*)

(**4**) B*p* → BB*p*

Gödel’s insight anticipated the discovery and development of modal
provability systems in the 1970s.

Gödel’s First Incompleteness Theorem (1931) is based on constructing a
sentence in a formal system that intuitively says, “I am *not*
provable.” In 1950 Leon Henkin asked if the sentence “I *am* provable”
is provable. In 1954 Martin Löb answered this question in the
affirmative. Then in 1963 Richard Montague stated the connections
between provability, modality and self-reference. However, it was not
until the 1970s that logicians fully formalized Gödel’s Incompleteness
Theorems showing that the abstract logic of provability could be
captured in propositional modal logic.

Modal logic is useful in clarifying our understanding of central results
concerning provability in the foundations of mathematics (see, Boolos
\[1993\]). Provabilty logics are systems where the propositional
variables range over formulas of some mathematical system such as Peano
Arithmetic. Gödel showed that arithmetic has strong expressive powers.
Using Gödel numbering as a method for coding arithmetic sentences, he
was able to demonstrate an effectively calculable correspondence between
sentences of arithmetic and facts about which sentences are and are not
provable in Peano Arithmetic.

In Provability Logics, ‘P’ is interpreted as expressing that ‘P is
provable’ in a system M such as Peano arithmetic. Using ‘⊥’ (read
“*eet*”, the reverse of ‘*tee*”, alternatively ‘*tac’* in contrast to
‘*top’*) as a constant of provability logic denoting falsehood or a
logical contradiction, the sentence

~ ⊥

says that a contradiction is not provable in system M and so says that M
is consistent. We define <span class="smallcaps">Consis</span>(M) to be
the above sentence. The best-known Provability logic adds an axiom
**GL** (for ‘Gödel-Löb)):

(ϕ → ϕ) → ϕ .

Axiom **T** ‘ϕ → ϕ’ says that Peano Arithmetic is *sound*, namely, that
if ϕ were provable, then ϕ would be true. This claim is too strong if we
wish to countenance the possibility that Peano Arithmetic might prove
something that is false. Intuitively, **GL** is the more modest claim
that if Peano Arithmetic proves a sentence that claims soundness for a
given sentence ϕ, then ϕ is already provable in Peano Arithmetic. Peano
Arithmetic does not insist that a proof of ϕ entails ϕ is true unless it
already has a proof of ϕ to back up that claim.

We specify a symbolic language for Gödel-Löb Provability logic as
follows. The symbols of this language will be

P, Q, R, …., Z sentence letter*s P through Z, without or without
numerical subscripts;*

⊥ *falsehood (eet, tac*);

→ conditional sign,

provability operator

), ( pair of parentheses.

The sentences of this language are exhaustively characterized by the
following clauses:

1.  *The logical constant* ‘⊥’ *is a symbolic sentence*

2.  *Sentence letters are symbolic sentences.*

3.  *If* ϕ *and* ψ *are symbolic sentences, then so is*

> (ϕ → ψ) .

1.  *If* ϕ *is a symbolic sentence, then so is*

> ϕ .

Using von Bentham’s notation, we can express the above formal language
concisely:

AT (for ‘atomic’) := P, Q, R, S, …, Z

ϕ : : = |AT|⊥|~ϕ| (ϕ → ψ) | ϕ|

The intended interpretations for these expressions are

1.  Sentence letters are sentences of Peano Arithmetic.

> \(2\) ⊥ is some designated falsehood such as ‘0 = 1’.
>
> \(3\) Expressions of the form (ϕ → ψ) are conditionals.
>
> \(4\) ‘ϕ’ is interpreted as saying that sentence ϕ is provable in
> Peano Arithmetic.

Note that {→, ⊥} is tautologically complete or ‘adequate’ to express all
binary truth functions.

A *provability system* M of type **4** consists of the inference rule MP
together with the axioms:

> (**K**) (ϕ →ψ) → (ϕ → ψ)
>
> (**4**) ϕ → ϕ .

The Gödel-Löb Provability Logic is a provability system type **4**
together with the axiom

> (**GL**) (ϕ → ϕ) → ϕ .

Next we can state three equivalent formulations of the fixed-point
properties of provability systems:

-   A system M is *self*-*reflexive* if ∀ formula ϕ, there exists a
    > sentence σ such that

> M ⊢ σ ↔ (σ → ϕ).

-   A system M has the *Löb property* if ∀ formula ϕ,

> M⊢ (ϕ → ϕ) ⇒ M|− ϕ .

-   A system M is *Gödelian* if ∀ formula ϕ,

> M ⊢ (ϕ → ϕ) ⇒ M|− ϕ .

<span class="smallcaps">Fixed-Point Metatheorem</span>. If M is type
**4**, then the following are equivalent:

1.  M is *self-reflexive*;

2.  M has the *Löb property*; and

3.  M is *Gödelian*.

We can now state abstract forms of the Gödel Incompleteness Theorems
within our modal provability systems. By the fixed-point lemma, there is
a sentence G such that

⊢ G ↔ ~G ,

This sentence, the *Gödel sentence*, intuitively says, “I am not
provable.” Notice that if the Gödel sentence is provable in some system
S then, if the above fixed-point biconditional is also provable, it
would be provable that the Gödel sentence is *not* provable, rendering
system S inconsistent.

Gödel’s First Incompleteness Theorem states that if Peano arithmetic is
consistent, then it cannot prove the Gödel sentence. Now the consistency
of Peano arithmetic can be expressed by a sentence stating that the
arithmetical falsehood 0 = 1 is not provable:

<span class="smallcaps">Cons</span>(PA): = ~ 0 = 1 .

Using these ideas, we can express Gödel’s First Theorem in modal
provability logic as follows:

<span class="smallcaps">Gödel’s First Incompleteness Theorem</span>.
Given that

⊢ G ↔ ~G ,

if Peano arithmetic is consistent, then it cannot prove the Gödel
sentence G, i.e.,

⊢ <span class="smallcaps">Cons</span>(PA) → ~ G .

Gödel’s Second Incompleteness Theorem exploits the fact that it is
provable that if <span class="smallcaps">Cons</span> (PA) is provable,
then G is provable. Let’s take a closer look at the subsidiary
derivation for what we might call *Gödel’s lemma*:

G → 0 = 1 .

Notice that taking the contraposition of Gödel’s lemma, we have

~ 0 = 1 → ~G ,

whose consequent, by the fixed-point lemma, implies G. Thus, we have by
the transitivity of the conditional:

~ 0 = 1 → ~G

↓

> G

Now by the (K) lemma, we distribute a of the antecedent and consequent
of the conditional theorem:

~ 0 = 1 → G ,

whose consequent, by the Gödel Lemma again, implies 0 = 1:

~ 0 = 1 → 0 = 1 .

By contraposition once more, we have:

~ 0 = 1 → ~~ 0 = 1 ,

which, by the definition of <span class="smallcaps">Cons</span>(PA) as ~
0 = 1, becomes:

<span class="smallcaps">Gödel’s Second Incompleteness Theorem</span>. If
Peano Arithmetic is consistent, the it cannot prove its own consistency,

What exactly was Gödel’s Second Incompleteness Theorem and what effect
did it has on Hilbert’s program? In addition to constructing the Gödel
statement G for the formal system S, the argument establishing the
implication “if S is consistent, then G is not provable in S” could be
carried out with S itself. Moreover, the property of being a Gödel
number of a proof in S is a computable one, and so ‘S is consistent’ is
a Goldbach-like statement, a statement which if false, can be shown to
be false by a computation. Thus, Gödel’s Second Incompleteness theorem
follows: if S proves the statement <span class="smallcaps">Con</span>(S)
expressing ‘S is consistent’ in the language of S, then S proves G, and
hence S is in fact inconsistent. Hilbert’s metamathematical program
calling for consistency proofs for formal systems such as arithmetic in
which all finitistic arguments can be formalized was effectively dashed
by the Second Incompleteness Theorem.

Franzén carefully points out three common misconceptions about the
Second Incompleteness Theorem. “First, it is often said that Gödel’s
proof shows G to be true, or to be ‘in some sense’ true. But the proof
does not show G to be true. What we learn from the proof is that G is
true if and only if S is consistent. In this observation, there is no
reason to use any such formulation as ‘in some sense true’…” Secondly,
Gödel’s theorem does not rule out consistency proofs using methods not
formalizable within Peano Arithmetic. Thirdly, “\[a\]nother aspect of
the second incompleteness theorem that needs to be emphasized is that it
does not show that S can only be proven consistent in a system that is
stronger than S.” For example, Gentzen proved the consistency of Peano
Arithmetic (PA) in 1936 by application of an arithmetically expressible
instance of transfinite induction up to Cantor’s ordinal ε0 (the least
fixed point under ordinal exponentiation to the base ω), while otherwise
using arguments that can be formalized in a very weak subsystem of PA.
So the consistency of PA is proved in a system that is overlaps in part
with PA but is not an extension of it.

# <span class="smallcaps">11. Philosophical Remarks (</span>*due to Nathan Salmon; slighted edited, redundancies remain*). 

Modal logic—the logic of what might have been and of what must be—raises
difficult issues and questions that remain a matter of significant
controversy. Some of these issues concern modal sentential logic, others
the blending of the logic of quantification with that of modality.

The principal issue concerning modal sentential logic involves nested
modality, wherein some modality is attributed to a state of affairs that
is itself already modal. Consider the following argument:

It is mathematically necessary that 2 + 3 = 5 .

Therefore, that 2 + 3 = 5 could not have been merely accidental .

It is unclear whether the premise entails this nested modal conclusion,
even if it is true, as opposed, say, to the unnested modal conclusion
that 2 + 3 = 5 is not accidental.

The sentential logic of un-nested modality is known as ‘**T**’. Let us
say that the antecedent of a necessary conditional *strictly implies*
the consequent. Then we may say that that **T** is motivated by four
principles: (1) that necessity and possibility are duals (i.e.,
something is necessary just in case its denial is impossible and that
something is impossible if its denial is necessary); (2) that whatever
is necessary is true; (3) that the logical truths of classical and modal
logic are necessary truths; and (4) that whatever is strictly implied by
a necessary truth is itself a necessary truth (i.e., if the antecedent
of a necessary conditional is itself necessary, then the consequent is
also necessary). Any deductive apparatus for modal logic that respects
these four principles is known as a *normal system*.

System ***T*** is the weakest normal system. It assigns no special logic
to the nesting or iteration of modality. Whereas the sentential logic of
un-nested modality is relatively uncontroversial, there exist numerous
rival systems dealing with nested modality. The most important normal
systems that impose a special logic on nested modality are **B** (named
for the intuitionist, L. E. J. Brouwer) and **S4** and **S5** (named
after C. I. Lewis’ systems for strict implication). Each of these three
systems builds on **T** through the addition of a specific principle
governing an iterated modality. Recall that system **B** adds the
principle that whatever is the case is such that its possibility is
necessary:

P → P ,

(or equivalently, whatever is possibly necessary is the case). System
***S4*** adds the principle that whatever is necessary is such that its
necessity is itself necessary:

P → P ,

(or equivalently, whatever is possibly possible is possible). System
***S5*** adds the principle that whatever is possible is such that its
possibility is necessary:

P → P ,

(or equivalently, whatever is possibly necessary is necessary). System
**S5** is the strongest of the four systems under discussion. Recall
that the ***S5*** principle, together with the basic sentential modal
logic **T**, yields both the **B** and **S4** principles. Whereas **S5**
thus includes **T**, **B**, and **S4**, neither of **B** and **S4**
includes the other.

The study of modal logic underwent a quantum leap with the advent of a
semantic analysis due to Saul Kripke \[1963\], among others, based on
Leibniz’ notion of a *possible world*. A possible world, on one
conception, is an entire world history that might have obtained.
Socrates might have been a Spartan if and only if there is a possible
world in (or, according to) which Socrates is a Spartan. In
possible-world semantics, the classical extensional semantic attributes,
like truth and denotation, are intensionalized by relativization to a
possible world.

A sentence is deemed true with respect to a possible world just in case
the proposition expressed is true in that world. Necessity of a
proposition is identified with its truth in all possible worlds,
possibility with truth in some possible worlds. More accurately, to say
that a proposition P is *necessary* in a world *w*<sub>1</sub> is to say
that P is true in every world *w*<sub>2</sub> that is a possible world
in *w*<sub>1</sub>—i.e., P is true in every world *w*<sub>2</sub> such
that in *w*<sub>1</sub>, *w*<sub>2</sub> is a genuine possibility (or,
possible relative to) *w*<sub>1</sub>. To say that a proposition P is
*possible* in a world *w*<sub>1</sub> is to say that P is true in at
least one world *w*<sub>2</sub> that is possible in (or, relative to)
*w*<sub>1</sub>. With these identifications, the sentential logic of
modality is easily derived from the classical logic of ‘*all’* and
‘*some’*, in much the same way that the logic of ‘*all’* and ‘*some’*
may be based on the logic of ‘*and’* and ‘*or’*. The four basic
principles of **T** emerge as analogues, respectively, of Quantifier
Negation, Universal Instantiation, Universal Derivation, and
<span class="smallcaps">T201</span>.

This conception of possible world semantics extends straightforwardly to
the iteration of modality. To say that P is necessarily necessary in a
world *w*<sub>1</sub> is to say that for every world *w*<sub>2</sub>
that is possible in *w*<sub>1</sub>, for every world *w*<sub>3</sub>
that is possible in *w*<sub>2</sub>, P is true in *w*<sub>3</sub>, i.e.,
P is true in every world that is possible in any world that is possible
in *w*<sub>1</sub>. \[What is possible in that world is possible in any
world.\] To say that *p* is necessarily possible in *w*<sub>1</sub> is
to say that for every world *w*<sub>2</sub> possible in *w*<sub>1</sub>,
there is least one world *w*<sub>3</sub> that is possible in
*w*<sub>2</sub> and in which *p* is true. In the terminology of Kripke,
a world *w*<sub>2</sub> is said to be *accessible to* a world
*w*<sub>1</sub> if *w*<sub>2</sub> is possible in *w*<sub>1</sub>. The
binary relation of accessibility is reflexive in any normal sentential
modal logical system. Kripke demonstrated a close connection between
each of the four main sentential modal logical systems and
accessibility. If accessibility is symmetric, then the **B** principle
is verified. If accessibility is transitive, the **S4** principle is
verified. And if it is an equivalence relationreflexive, symmetric, and
transitivethe **S5** principle is verified.

There are many notions of necessity. Whereas it is logically necessary
that either nine is odd or it is not, it is *mathematically* necessary
that nine is indeed odd. It is *metaphysically* necessary, and arguably
also logically necessary, that if *x* and *y* are one and the same
object, then *x* and *y* are exactly alike in every respect. (As
mentioned in chapter V, this Leibnizian principle of the
*indiscernibility of identicals* is reflected in the inference rule of
Leibniz’ Law.) Whereas it is *physically* necessary that the force
acting on a physical object is equal to the product of the mass of the
object with its acceleration, this is neither *logically* nor
*mathematically* nor *metaphysically* necessary. Not all notions of
necessity need share the same logic.

Physical necessity may be seen as a restricted notion of necessity: A
proposition P is *physically necessary* in a world *w* just in case the
laws of the physics of *w* strictly imply it, in the sense that P is
true in every world that is accessible to *w* and in which the physical
laws of *w* are true. Though any actual physical law is thus
*physically* necessary, that same law may be *metaphysically*
contingent; there may be a world that is accessible to the actual world
and in which the law fails. Had there been an additional physical law
over and above those that actually obtain (perhaps because of the
physical possibility of some universal generalization that does not in
fact obtain, or of the evolution of some species that does not in fact
exist), the actual physical laws together with the additional law would
all be physically necessary, and the actual state of affairs thus
physically impossible. This would rule out B, hence also **S5**, as the
logic of physical modality.

It is often maintained that metaphysical necessity is unrestricted
necessity. A proposition is *metaphysically* necessary in a world *w*,
it is observed, just in case it is true in every possible world
accessible to *w*, without exception. This would yield the result that
the sentential logic of metaphysical modality is **S5**. The argument
for the **S5** principle that *whatever is metaphysically possible is
metaphysically necessarily so* is straightforward: Assume that *p* is
metaphysically possible. Then there is at least one possible world *w*
(which may or may not bear any special relation to the actual world) in
which P is true. In that case, for every possible world *w′*, without
exception, there is at least one world (which may or may not bear any
special relation to *w*′) in which P is true, *viz*., *w*. Though many
philosophers have been persuaded by this argument, it is in fact
fallacious.

Whether a given world is metaphysically possible or not might be a
contingent fact. The same world that is metaphysically possible in
(i.e., accessible to) one world might be metaphysically impossible in
another. Even metaphysical modality thus involves one crucial
restriction: P is metaphysically necessary in a world *w* just in case
*p* is true in every world *that is metaphysically possible in* *w*; and
P­­­­­­ is metaphysically possible in *w* just in case *p* is true in at least
one world *that is metaphysically possible in* *w*<sub>1</sub>. Suppose
*p* is metaphysically possible in some world *w*<sub>1</sub> (e.g., the
actual world), so that there is a world *w*<sub>2</sub> that is
metaphysically possible in *w*<sub>1</sub> and in which P is true. It
does not follow that for every world *w*<sub>3</sub> metaphysically
possible in *w*<sub>1</sub>, there is a world that is metaphysically
possible in *w*<sub>3</sub> and in which *p* is true. What follows
instead is that for every world *w*<sub>3</sub> possible in
*w*<sub>1</sub>, there is a world—*viz*., *w*<sub>2</sub>—that is
possible *in a world in which w<sub>3</sub> is possible* and in which
*p* is true. But we have so far no reason to suppose that
*w*<sub>2</sub> is possible in *w*<sub>3</sub>, and hence no reason to
suppose that there is a world that is possible in every world possible
in *w*<sub>1</sub> and in which *p* is true.

To presuppose that because *w*<sub>2</sub> and *w*<sub>3</sub> are each
possible in *w*<sub>1</sub>, *w*<sub>2</sub> is likewise possible in
*w*<sub>3</sub> is tantamount to the assumption that accessibility is
*euclidean*:

∀*x*∀*y*∀*z*(R*xz* & R*yz* ⇒ R*xy*) .

A binary relation is both reflexive and euclidean if and only if it is
an equivalence relation. But the argument provides no reason to suppose
that accessibility is euclidean.

On the contrary, there is a compelling reason to suppose that
metaphysical accessibility is *not* transitive (let alone an equivalence
relation)—or at least, that logic does not preclude the prospect that
accessibility is intransitive. Some metaphysicians (including the
present writer) maintain that a typical material artifact, such as a
bicycle or a ship, might have originated from at least slightly
different matter (molecules) from its actual original matter, but could
not have originated from altogether different matter. This suggests that
for each material artifact, there is a threshold or limit such that the
artifact might have originated from matter different from its actual
original matter up to that limit, but could not have originated from
matter that differs any more than that.

Consider the *Paradox of the Ship of Theseus* goes back to a Greek
legend reported by Plutarch:

The ship wherein Theseus and the youth of Athens returned \[from Crete\]
had thirty oars, and was preserved by the Athenians down even to the
time of Demetrius Phalereus, for they took away the old planks as they
decayed, putting in new and stronger timber in their place, insomuch
that this ship became a standing example among the philosophers, for the
logical question of things that grow; one side holding that the ship
remained the same, and the other contending that it was not the same.

There is also an additional perplexity: if the replaced parts were
stored in a warehouse and later used to reconstruct the ship, which—if
either—would be the original ship of Theseus?

Suppose, without any loss of generality, that in a world *w* (perhaps
the actual world), a given ship *S* which originated from particular
matter *m* might have originated instead from the same amount of matter
but with as many as 10% different molecules, and could not have
originated from the same amount of matter as *m* while differing from
*m* by more than 10%. Then there is a world *w*′ that is metaphysically
possible in (i.e., accessible to) *w* and in which *S* originated from
particular matter *m*′ that is 90% of *m* together with 10% different
matter. Now in *w*′, *S* might have originated from matter that differs
from *m′* by as much as 10%. Hence, there is a world *w″* that is
possible in *w*′ and in which ship *S* originated from particular matter
*m*″ that is more than 90% the same as *m*′, but less than 90% of *m*
with more than 10% different matter from *m*. But in *w*, *S* could not
have originated from *w*″. Hence, though *w*″ is possible in *w*′, which
is itself possible in *w*, *w″* is not possible in *w*. In *w*, *w*″ is
an impossible (albeit possibly possible) world. It is only contingently
necessary in *w* that ship *S* does not originate from matter *m*″. This
yields a counter-instance to the **S4** principle that whatever is
necessary is necessarily so.

On this metaphysics of materiality, metaphysical accessibility is
intransitive. Opponents may argue that any such metaphysic is not only
incorrect but necessarily so. Nevertheless, it cannot be plausibly
argued that such a metaphysic is logically inconsistent. On the
contrary, whether it is necessarily correct or necessarily incorrect,
the theory in question is obviously coherent. Hence the logic of
metaphysical modality is not as strong as **S5**, or even **S4**. No
equally plausible counter-instance to **B** (as a deductive system
governing metaphysical modality) is presently known. But even if the
**B** principle is correct, here also it seems that its truth is not
required by logic. As far as logic is concerned, the actual world might
have been a metaphysically impossible world instead of a metaphysically
possible one (even if this prospect is metaphysically impossible).

The logic of combining of modality with quantifiers is known as
*quantified modal logic*. Quantifiers and Leibniz’ Law call for special
attention in modal logic. According to the logician Willard van Orman
Quine, identity is governed by Leibniz’s Law stated as a *principle of
substitutivity*: the terms of a true identity statement are everywhere
intersubstitutive, preserving truth (or *salva veritate)*. As soon at
the principle is stated, however, one is confronted with
counterexamples. For example, although there are (let us suppose)
exactly nine planets in the solar system, this is surely a matter of
contingent fact—there might have been eight planets instead of nine.
Though it is mathematically necessary that nine is odd, it is no
necessary truth that the number of planets is odd. A puzzle, which we
will call *Quine’s conundrum*, points to a needed restriction on
Leibniz’ Law formulated as a principle of substitutivity. Relative to
the scheme of abbreviation,

> A : 9
>
> F : *a* is odd
>
> G : *a* numbers the planets,

The sentence

\(0\) FA

is true, whereas

\(1\) Fι*y*G*y*

is false, even though

A = ι*y*G*y*

is true. Where a symbolic term ζ stands within a formula ϕ<sub>ζ</sub>
within the scope of an occurrence of a modal operator, and either ζ or η
is a definite description, Leibniz’ Law may be weakened as follows:

ζ = η

ϕ<sub>ζ</sub>

ϕ<sub>η</sub>

where ϕ<sub>η</sub> is like ϕ<sub>ζ</sub> except for having free
occurrences of η where ϕ<sub>ζ</sub> has free occurrences of ζ. The
stronger form of Leibniz’s Law given in Chapter V remains operative when
neither of the symbolic terms ζ nor η is a definite description, and
also when ϕ<sub>η</sub> is like ϕ<sub>ζ</sub> except for having free
occurrences of η where ϕ<sub>ζ</sub> has free occurrences of ζ not
within the scope of an occurrence of a modal operator. A more general
form of Leibniz’s Law is employed in this chapter, specifically:

… ξ = η

ϕ<sub>ζ</sub>

ϕ<sub>η</sub>

where ‘…’ represents a string of occurrences of ‘’ whose length is
unrestricted if neither ζ nor η is a definite description, and is
otherwise at least as great as the largest number of occurrences in
φ<sub>ζ</sub> of symbolic formulas of the form

ψ

or of the form

ψ

where ψ is a symbolic formula, such that there is a free occurrence of ζ
that stands within each (i.e., the largest number of modal-operator
occurrences having the same free occurrence of ζ in their scope).

A choice needs to be made concerning the range of quantification with
respect to a given world. *Possibilist quantification* allows the
quantifiers to range over all possible individuals with respect to all
worlds. So-called *actualist* (or internal) quantification, which is the
alternative employed in this chapter, allows <s>lets</s> each quantifier
range with respect to a world *w* only over the individuals that exist
in *w*. Universal derivation and the rules of existential instantiation,
universal instantiation, and existential generalization are modified
accordingly. This choice also excludes as theorems the *Barcan formula*

∀*x*F*x* → ∀*x*F*x ,*

and its converse, as well as the *Martin*

*formula*,

∃*x*F*x* → ∃*x*F*x* ,

and its converse. Instead there is a *weakened version of the converse
Barcan formula*,

∀*x*F*x →* ∀*x* (∃*y* *x* = *y* → F*x*) ,

as well as a *weakened version of the Buridan formula*,

∃*x*(∃*y x* = *y* ∧ F*x*) → ∃*x*F*x .*

Each of these formulas involves quantification across a modal operator
into a modal context. Quine argued that such constructions are
problematic at best, perhaps even incoherent. Consider the number, which
is both nine and the number of planets, apart from any particular manner
of specification. Is it a necessary truth about this number that it is
odd? Abstracting from any particular manner of specification (or what
Frege \[1892\] called a *mode of presentation*) of the number, then the
grounds for saying that it is a necessary feature of the number that it
is odd—*viz*., that it is necessary that *nine* is odd—seem perfectly
counterbalanced by equally good grounds for saying that the oddness is
only a contingent feature: it is not necessary that *the number of
planets* is odd. Yet Leibniz’ Law prohibits one from consistently saying
that oddness is a necessary feature of nine and, at the same time, only
an accidental feature of the number of planets. For the number of
planets *is* nine; hence, any property of the number of planets (e.g.,
being contingently odd) is equally a property of nine, and vice versa.

More formally, there seems to be no coherent answer to the question of
whether the number that is both nine and the number of planets satisfies
the open formula

\(2\) F*x*

relative to the scheme of abbreviation displayed above. A symbolic
formula of the form

ϕ ,

where φ is a symbolic formula, is true with respect to a world *w*, and
under an assignment *s* of values to variables, just in case the
proposition expressed by ϕ under assignment *s* is a proposition that is
a necessary truth in *w*—i.e., just in case ϕ is true, under *s*, with
respect to every world accessible to *w*. In particular, a symbolic
formula of the form

Fα ,

where α is a symbolic term that denotes the number nine, is true on the
scheme of abbreviation displayed above, and under an assignment *s* of
values to variables, if and only if the proposition expressed by

Fα ,

on the same scheme of abbreviation and under assignment *s*, is a
necessary truth. But which proposition is expressed depends on the
manner in which the term α specifies nine. If α specifies nine as *the
successor of eight* (or as *the predecessor of ten*, *the square of
three*, etc.), a necessary truth is expressed. If α specifies nine as
*the number of planets* (or as *Bill’s favorite odd number*, etc.), a
contingent truth is expressed. When the variable ‘*x*’ occurring in (2)
is assigned the number of planets as its value, it denotes nine but does
not specify nine in any particular manner. We are thus at a loss
concerning whether the formula ‘F*x*’ expresses a necessary truth under
that assignment. The result of substituting ‘A’ for ‘*x*’ in (2) is
true, whereas the result of substituting ‘ι*y*G*y*’ is false, even
though each of the two substituends—‘A’ and ‘ι*y*G*y*’—denotes nine.
This situation appears to render the construction ‘∃*x*F*x*’ without a
coherent interpretation.

As Arthur Smullyan \[1948\] noted against Quine, Russell’s \[1905\]
theory of descriptions, when applied to quantified modal logic, yields a
straightforward solution to this conundrum. According to Russell’s
theory, a definite description is not a term, and symbolic sentence (1)
is subject to an ambiguity of scope. One reading of the sentence (the
Russellian “*secondary occurrence*” reading) is given by:

∃*x*\[∀*y*(G*y* ↔ *x* = *y*) ∧ F*x*\] ,

i.e., necessarily, something that uniquely numbers the planets is odd.
This is false, since there might have been an even number of planets.
The other reading of (1) (the “*primary occurrence*” reading) is given
by:

∃*x*\[∀*y*(G*y* ↔ *x* = *y*) ∧ F*x*\] ,

i.e., something that uniquely numbers the planets is necessarily odd.
This is evidently true, since the number in question (nine, i.e., the
number of planets) is such that it could not have been an even number
instead of odd.

The matter of interpreting (2) is straightforward on a Russellian
theory. (Notice, however, that Russell’s theory of descriptions plays no
role in the interpretation.) The proposition expressed by ‘F*x*’
relative to the scheme of abbreviation displayed above, and under the
assignment of the number of planets as value for the variable ‘*x*’, is
the proposition about the number in question that it is odd. The latter
is a *singular proposition*, one that is about a particular individual
that occurs as a propositional component, representing itself in the
proposition. The singular proposition about nine that it is odd is true
in any possible world in which nine is an odd number (whether or not it
numbers the planets in that world). Formula (2), when evaluated under
the assignment in question, functions in a manner exactly analogous to
(0).

Semantic theories—like those of Frege \[1892\], Church \[1946\], and
Quine \[1950\]—that reject singular propositions may not avail
themselves of this theoretically elegant and satisfying solution to
Quine’s conundrum. Such theories fail to provide a proposition to serve
as the content of an open formula like ‘F*x*’, leaving (2) in need of
interpretation. The insistence that denotation is invariably determined
by an accompanying manner of specification leads to a famous problem in
modal metaphysics: the so-called problem of *cross-world
identification*.

The open formula ‘F*x*’ is true relative to the scheme of abbreviation
displayed above, and under the assignment of nine as value for the
variable ‘*x*’, if and only if for every possible world *w* (i.e., for
every world *w* accessible to the actual world), the individual denoted
by the variable ‘*x*’ with respect to *w*, and under the same assignment
of nine as value, is odd in *w*. The problem is that, though the
variable ‘*x*’ is assigned nine (*qua* the number of planets) as its
value with respect to the actual world, it is not assigned any
particular manner of specification of nine (e.g., as *the number of
planets*, as *the successor of eight*, or in some alternative manner).
This fails to provide any fact of the matter concerning which item from
*w*, if any, is the value of ‘*x*’ with respect to *w*.

There is a question concerning which object from *w* is to be identified
with the actual number of planets? This alleged problem does not even
arise once it is recognized that the variable ‘*x*’ is what Russell
called a *logically proper name* of its value. That is, the proposition
expressed by the open formula ‘F*x*’ relative to the scheme of
abbreviation displayed above, and under the assignment of nine as value
for ‘*x*’, is simply the singular proposition about nine that it is odd.
One very significant benefit of countenancing singular propositions, in
fact, is that the “problem” of cross-world identification is thereby
exposed as a pseudo-problem.

**Section 12. Historical Remarks.**

*Modal logic* is the study of the logical structure of these modes of
truth. Ancient philosophers like Aristotle tried to study their logic,
and the medieval logicians such as Jean Buridan discussed modal notions
with great subtlety.

Chronology for Modal Logic</span>

However, the modern treatment of modal logic began around 1912 when C.
I. Lewis, after reading Russell and Whitehead’s *Principia*
*Mathematica*, proposed various axioms (such as **4** and **5**) to find
a connective more suitable than the material conditional to express our
informal concept of entailment. In the 1930s Gödel discussed an
interpretation of the modal operator as ‘it is provable in system M
that,’ and in the 1950s *epistemic*, *doxastic*, *deontic* and
*tense-logic* interpretations were intensively investigated.

Around the 1960s modal logic was being investigated by numerous
logicians—including, among others, Rudolf Carnap, Jackko Hintikka,
Richard Montague, and von Wright. However, it was Saul Kripke’s
remarkable paper *A Completeness Theorem in Modal Logic* (1961)
published while he was a high school student in Nebraska that presented
possible world semantics in an elegant way that ignited decades of
logical and philosophical research. Kripke’s *possible world semantics*
gave formal expression to the Leibnizian idea that a proposition is
*necessary* if it is true in *all* possible worlds, possible if it is
true in *some* possible world, and *contingent* if it is neither
necessary nor impossible.

Around the 1970s it was noticed that the famous incompleteness theorems
of Gödel (1931) were propositional in character and that their logic
could be captured in propositional modal logics known as Provability
Logics based on Löb’s axiom and Gödel’s well-ordering axiom.

[1] This exposition of the standard systems of propositional modal logic
in the style of Kalish, Montague and Mar was written with helpful
comments from Nathan Salmon, who originally published the elegant idea
of incorporating the axioms for the various system of propositional
modal logic as restrictions on the rule of repetition within a strict
derivation. These restrictions for **T**, **B**, **S4** and **S5**
correspond to Kripke’s accessibility conditions of relative possibility
in his axiomatic formulation of propositional modal logic.

[2] The theological, if not the political, roots Great Schism of 1054,
which can be traced back to a disagreement about the modalities of the
Persons of the Trinity. The Nicean Creed (325) use the term *homoousios*
(from the Greek *homo* = ‘same‘ and *ousios* = ‘essence’ or
‘substance’), in contrast to *homoiousios* (from the Greek *homoi* =
‘similar’) making the solitary *i* the jot and tittle of Nicean Creedal
Orthodoxy. The Greek Church preferred the latter term since the former
had been used by the Syrian Bishop of Antioch to espouse *modal
monarchism*, the heresy that the Heavenly Father, Resurrected Son and
Holy Spirit are not three distinct Persons, but are rather
different *modes* or *aspects* of one monadic God perceived by believers
as distinct persons. The Latin Church adopted the former siding with
Athanasius against the heretic Arius, who denied that Jesus was co-equal
and co-eternal with the Father. The Second Council of Nicea (381), among
other changes, inserted the word *filioque* (from the Latin *filio* =
the son, and *que* = “and”) into the Nicean-Constantinopolitan Creed and
the Latin mass. In Latin theology, the three Persons of the Trinity are
logically distinguished by the formal relations of “proceeding from”
citing such proof texts as Phil. 1:9, Titus 3:6, Acts 2:33. Orthodox
theology, citing the words of Jesus in proof texts such John 15:26,
regarded the insertion of *filioque* into the Nicean-Constantipolitan
creed, is as Semi-Sabellianism. The great church historian Jaroslav
Pelikan (*The Melody of Theology*, Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University
Press, 1988, p. 90) opined: “If there is a special circle of the inferno
described by Dante reserved for historians of theology, the principal
homework assigned to that subdivision of Hell for at least the first
several eons of eternity may well be a thorough study of all the
treatises… devoted to the inquiry: Does the Holy Spirit proceed from the
Father only, as Eastern Christendom contends, or from both the Father
and the Son as the Latin Church teaches?” In 1989 Pope John Paul II and
Patriarch Demetrius knelt together in Rome and recited the Nicene Creed
without the *filioque*.

[3] van Bentham \[2010\], p. 51, notes “this often-cited analogy is not
quite right, if you think about it.”
