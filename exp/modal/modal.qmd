## [Modes of Truth and Modal Logics]{.smallcaps}

Historically, notions like *necessity*, *possibility*, *impossibility*,
and *contingency* were thought of as modes of truth or ways in which a
proposition could be true or false. *Modal logic* began as the study of
the logic of these modes of truth.

Aristotle, in Chapter 9 of *De Interpretatione*, discusses modality in
his famous example of the sea battle. Suppose the sea battle will be
fought tomorrow. Then it was true yesterday that it would be fought
tomorrow. So if all past truths are necessarily true, then it is
necessarily true now that the battle will be fought tomorrow. A similar
argument holds on the supposition that the sea battle will not be fought
tomorrow. Aristotle proposed solving this problem of *logical fatalism*
by denying that future contingent propositions have definite
truth-values.

Using the ‘$\Box$’ for ‘it is necessary that’, the principle that all
necessary truths are in fact 
$$
\Box P\to P,\tag*{(\textbf{T})}
$$ {#eq-modal-axiom-T}
but adding its converse that all truths are necessary truths:
$$
P \to \Box P \tag*{(\textbf{V})}
$$ {#eq-modal-axiom-V}
collapses the notions of truth and necessary truth.

Medieval philosophers, concerned with such theological issues as
articulating the nature of the Trinity, appealed to such modal notions
as essence and accident, contingency and necessity in their labyrinthine
theological reflections.[^modal-2] Akin to the problem is logical fatalism is
the problem of *theological fatalism*: the problem of reconciling divine
foreknowledge and human freedom. Saint Augustine (354--430) in his
treatise *On the Free Choice of Will* considers an argument for
*theological fatalism* proposed by Evodius. Evodius argued that “God
foreknew that man would sin, that which God foreknew must necessarily
come to pass.” We may set forth this argument for theological fatalism
for a particular case as follows:

[^modal-2]: 
    The theological, if not the political, roots Great Schism of 1054,
    which can be traced back to a disagreement about the modalities of the
    Persons of the Trinity. The Nicean Creed (325) uses the term *homoousios*
    (from the Greek *homo* = ‘same‘ and *ousios* = ‘essence’ or
    ‘substance’), in contrast to *homoiousios* (from the Greek *homoi* =
    ‘similar’) making the solitary *i* the jot and tittle of Nicean Creedal
    Orthodoxy. The Greek Church preferred the latter term since the former
    had been used by the Syrian Bishop of Antioch to espouse *modal
    monarchism*, the heresy that the Heavenly Father, Resurrected Son and
    Holy Spirit are not three distinct Persons, but are rather
    different *modes* or *aspects* of one monadic God perceived by believers
    as distinct persons. The Latin Church adopted the former siding with
    Athanasius against the heretic Arius, who denied that Jesus was co-equal
    and co-eternal with the Father. The Second Council of Nicea (381), among
    other changes, inserted the word *filioque* (from the Latin *filio* =
    the son, and *que* = “and”) into the Nicean-Constantinopolitan Creed and
    the Latin mass. In Latin theology, the three Persons of the Trinity are
    logically distinguished by the formal relations of “proceeding from”
    citing such proof texts as Phil. 1:9, Titus 3:6, Acts 2:33. Orthodox
    theology, citing the words of Jesus in proof texts such John 15:26,
    regarded the insertion of *filioque* into the Nicean-Constantipolitan
    creed, is as Semi-Sabellianism. The great church historian Jaroslav
    Pelikan opined: “If there is a special circle of the inferno
    described by Dante reserved for historians of theology, the principal
    homework assigned to that subdivision of Hell for at least the first
    several eons of eternity may well be a thorough study of all the
    treatises… devoted to the inquiry: Does the Holy Spirit proceed from the
    Father only, as Eastern Christendom contends, or from both the Father
    and the Son as the Latin Church teaches?” In 1989 Pope John Paul II and
    Patriarch Demetrius knelt together in Rome and recited the Nicene Creed
    without the *filioque*.

- If God knew that Adam would sin, then, necessarily Adam sinned.

- Therefore, Adam necessarily sinned.
:::

St. Thomas Aquinas (1225--1274) in his *Summa Contra Gentiles* (part I,
chapter 67) criticized this kind of argument as resting on an amphiboly.
The critical first premise “if God knew Adam would sin, then,
*necessarily*, Adam sinned” is ambiguous between

then Adam will sin.

will sin.
:::
\renewcommand\labelitemi{\labelitemito}

Aquinas called [(1*a*)](#eq-modal-1a) the *necessity of the consequence* contrasting it
with [(1*b*)](#eq-modal-1b) the *necessity of the consequent*. Using the ‘$\Box$’ to
abbreviate ‘it is necessary that’, the difference between these two can
be made more perspicuous with symbols:
$$
\Box (P \to Q) \tag*{(1\textit{a})}
$$ {#eq-modal-symbol-1a}
$$
(P \to \Box Q) \tag*{(1\textit{b})}
$$ {#eq-modal-symbol-1b}
Solving the famous theological problem of reconciling divine foreknowledge
with human freedom may turn on exposing ambiguities of this sort.

Perhaps the most famous theological application of modal logic is Saint
Anselm’s modal ontological argument. According to Saint Anselm (1033--1109), 
it follows from God’s nature that it is necessary that God exists
if God exists at all. Moreover, this conditional itself, being a
conceptual truth, is itself necessarily true. We then have the following
argument:

\renewcommand\labelitemi{}
::: {.nobullet}
- Necessarily, if God exists, then God necessarily exists.
- It is possible that God exists.
- Therefore, God (actually) exists.
:::
\renewcommand\labelitemi{\labelitemito}

Using ‘$\Diamond$’ for ‘it is possible that’, the above argument can be
symbolized:
$$
\Box(G\to\Box G).\quad\Diamond G\quad\therefore G\tag*{(2)}
$$ {#eq-modal-2}

The question of whether Anselm’s argument is valid became a precise
question when various systems of modal logic were proposed and developed
in the 1960s. 

Gottlob Frege (1848--1925), the inventor (or discoverer) of modern
predicate-quantifier logic, relegated modality to autobiographical
information about the speaker, and for many years logicians only
investigated extensional logic.

One of the most puzzling validities, at least to the beginning logical
students is known as *Lewis’s Dilemma*:
$$P\land\lnot P\to Q,$$
which states *“a contradiction implies anything”*^[Or *"ex falso quodlibet"*, in Latin.]. 
This implication follows from the inference rules of simplification, addition, and *modus
tollendo ponens*^[*"mode that denies by affirming"*], which are themselves not particularly puzzling.

C. I. Lewis investigated modal logic in order to find a stricter form of
the conditional which would not result in such paradoxes. Lewis defined
*strict implication* $P\Rightarrow Q$ (read “$P$ *strictly implies* $Q$”) by combining
modality with the truth-functional conditional:
$$
P\Rightarrow Q\quad:=\quad\Box(P\land\lnot Q),
$$
or alternatively,
$$
P\Rightarrow Q\quad:=\quad\Box(P\to Q).
$$

The notion of strict implication was characterized by such axioms as:

The philosopher Leibniz (1646--1716) explicitly invoked that language
of possible worlds to explain the difference between necessary and
contingent truths. What is logically or necessarily true are those
truths truth in *all* possible worlds, whereas a contingent truth is one
that is true in *some* possible worlds.

Drawing upon this logical connection between universal and existential
quantification and the modal notions of necessity and possibility, we
obtain a modal version of the classical Aristotelian Square of
Opposition and the duality of modal laws known as the laws of modal
negation.

[An Aristotelian Diamond of Opposition]{.smallcaps}
:::

In the modern development of modal logic, logicians noticed that a host
other phenomena—such as deontic notions of obligation and
permissibility, epistemic notions of knowledge and belief, as well as
temporal operators—share these logical relations and hence can be
represented as modal logics.

In *deontic logic*, $\Box$ is read “it is morally obligatory that” and $\Diamond$ is
read “it is morally permissible that”. Kant’s maxim that “ought implies
can”, that is, whatever is obligatory is permissible, is captured by
modal axiom [(**D**)](#eq-modal-axiom-D):
$$
\Box P \to\Diamond P.\tag*{(\textbf{D})}
$$ {#eq-modal-axiom-D}

In *epistemic logic*, $\Box$ is read for some subject $S$ “it is known that”
and $\Diamond$ is read “it is believed that”. Some modal axioms for epistemic
logic that have been considered include:

$$ {#eq-modal-axiom-E}
::::
\vspace{-1\parskip}

The axiom [(**K**)](#eq-modal-axiom-K) expresses logical omniscience insofar as this axiom
requires that the knowledge of an agent is closed under *modus ponens*;
and hence such knowers know all the logical consequences of their
knowledge.

Axiom [(**T**)](#eq-modal-axiom-K) states the truism that whatever is known is true. Notice
that this axiom would be too strong for deontic logic insofar as an
action’s being obligatory doesn’t imply that the agent actually performs
that action.

Axiom [(**4**)](#eq-modal-axiom-4) expresses a high degree of *positive introspective
knowledge*: if someone knows P, then she knows that she knows that $P$.
Axiom [(**E**)](#eq-modal-axiom-E) on the other hand, expresses a high degree of *negative*
introspective knowledge: if someone doesn’t know that $P$, then he knows
he doesn’t know $P$. This axiom is contrary to the experience of Socrates:
as the gadfly of Athens, Socrates found through his questioning that
many of his fellow Athenians did not know what they were talking about
but also didn’t know that they didn’t know. The gadfly of Athens
believed his vocation was to sting his fellow Athenians into the
awareness they were own ignorance, a service for which they did not
always show adequate appreciation.

The *temporal logic* or Diodorian temporal logic was studied by the
logician A. N. Prior (1914--1969). To model temporal language, we
introduce a pair of modal operators for the future and a pair of modal
operators for the past.

The axioms for minimal tense logic include version of Axiom [(**K**)](#eq-modal-axiom-K) for
the two necessity operators:
\begin{align*}
&{\color{red}\Box}(\varphi\to\psi)\to({\color{red}\Box}\varphi\to{\color{red}\Box}\psi)
&\begin{aligned}\text{\textit{Whatever has always followed from what always has been,}}\\\text{\textit{always has been.}}\end{aligned}&
\tag*{(K${\color{red}\Box}$)}\\\\
&{\color{green}\Box}(\varphi\to\psi)\to({\color{green}\Box}\varphi\to{\color{green}\Box}\psi)
&\begin{aligned}\text{\textit{Whatever will always follow from what always will be,}}\\\text{\textit{always will be.}}\end{aligned}&
\tag*{(K${\color{green}\Box}$)}
\end{align*}

It also contains two axioms concerning the interaction of the past and
future that has the form of the so-called Brouwersche axiom with
alternating valences:
\begin{align*}
&\varphi\to{\color{green}\Box}{\color{red}\Diamond}\varphi
&\text{\textit{What is, will always have been}}
\tag*{(B${\color{green}\Box}{\color{red}\Diamond}$)}\\
&\varphi\to{\color{red}\Box}{\color{green}\Diamond}\varphi
&\text{\textit{What is, has always been going to happen}}
\tag*{(B${\color{red}\Box}{\color{green}\Diamond}$)}\\
\end{align*}

The Brouwersche [(**B**)](#eq-modal-axiom-B) axiom was so-named by the logician Oskar Becker
[@Becker1930Logik]
after the charismatic Dutch mathematician L. E. J. Brouwer (1881--1966), who championed a philosophy of mathematics known as
*intuitionism*. It happens that when the $\Diamond$ can be paraphrased as $\Diamond\lnot\Diamond$,
the resulting axiom has the form of the acceptable form of double
negation in intuitionistic logic:
$$
\varphi\to\lnot\Diamond\lnot\Diamond\varphi\tag*{(\textbf{B})}
$$ {#eq-modal-axiom-B}

According to intuitionism, mathematical objects do not exist as eternal
Platonic objects but are constructions in intuition. Intuitionists read
the propositional connectives as involving not merely truth, but proof,
and so they rejected such classical forms of reasoning as *reductio ad
absurdum* and theorems such as the *law of excluded middle.*
Intuitionists reject the following mathematical proof.

## A Classical Theorem in Intuitionism

**Theorem.** There exist two irrational numbers $x$ and $y$ such that $x^y$ is irrational.

::: {.proof}
Consider
$$
\sqrt{2}^{\left(\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}\right)}
=\sqrt{2}^{\left(\sqrt{2}\cdot\sqrt{2}\right)}
=\sqrt{2}^2=2,
$$
which is rational.

\renewcommand\labelitemi{\labelitemito}
The number $\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}$ is either rational or irrational.

- If it's rational, then $x=y=\sqrt{2}$ are both irrational yet $x^y$ is rational.
- If $\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}$ is irrational, then $x=\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}$ and $y=\sqrt{2}$
  are both irrational and $x^y$ is rational.

Either way there exist $x$ and $y$ such that $x^y$ is rational.
<span style="float: right;" when-format="html">$\Box$</span>
:::

Intuitionists reject this classical argument by separation of cases because it does not 
actually construct the numbers $x$ and $y$ such that $xy$ is irrational.
The idea behind intuitionistic logic is that the connectives are reinterpreted as
involving a kind of provability.
::::
:::::

Around the 1970s it was noticed that the famous incompleteness theorems
[@Godel1931Incomepleteness] were propositional in character and that their logic
could be captured in propositional modal logic. These modal provability
logics added to Axiom [(**K**)](#eq-modal-axiom-K) the following axiom, known
as the Gödel-Löb axiom or also the well-ordering axiom.
$$
\Box(\Box\varphi\to\varphi)\to\Box\varphi\tag*{(\textbf{W})}
$$ {#eq-modal-axiom-W}

*Modal Provability Logics* proliferated from the 1950s--1970s, but the
genesis of the idea goes back to a short note [@Godel1933] in
which he noted that intuitionistic truth is defined in terms of proof since
provability is a kind of necessity. The above axiom can be read as a
kind of soundness theorem.

\renewcommand\labelitemi{}
::: {.nobullet}
- *if it is provable that $\varphi$ being provable implies it is true, then $\varphi$ is
provable.*
:::
\renewcommand\labelitemi{\labelitemito}

Later we will show how to use a modal provability logic to exhibit the
propositional logic of key parts of Gödel’s First and Second
Incompleteness Theorems.

In contemporary logic, modal logic has grown beyond these philosophical
origins and is at the interface of a number of disciplines including the
studies information flow and dynamics, game theory, and computability.

#### Exercises {.unnumbered}

(@) Symbolize the following modal arguments.
    (A) Eratosthenes must either be in Syene or Alexandria. Eratosthenes
        cannot be in Syene. Therefore, Eratosthenes must be in Alexandria.
    (B) Assume that justice can be defined as paying your debts and telling
        the truth. Then it is *morally obligatory* for Cephalus to comply to
        a madman’s request that Cephalus return a borrowed sword and that
        Cephalus tell the truth about the whereabouts of a friend whom
        the madman wants to kill with the sword. However, if this act is
        *morally obligatory*, then it is *morally permissible*. However, it
        is *morally impermissible* (or *morally forbidden*) for Cephalus to
        comply. So it isn’t *morally obligatory* for Cephalus to comply.
        Justice, therefore, cannot be defined as paying your debts and
        telling the truth.
    (C) It is conceivable that I am having experiences qualitatively
