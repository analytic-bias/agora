## [Modes of Truth and Modal Logics]{.smallcaps}

Historically, notions like *necessity*, *possibility*, *impossibility*,
and *contingency* were thought of as modes of truth or ways in which a
proposition could be true or false. *Modal logic* began as the study of
the logic of these modes of truth.

Aristotle, in Chapter 9 of *De Interpretatione*, discusses modality in
his famous example of the sea battle. Suppose the sea battle will be
fought tomorrow. Then it was true yesterday that it would be fought
tomorrow. So if all past truths are necessarily true, then it is
necessarily true now that the battle will be fought tomorrow. A similar
argument holds on the supposition that the sea battle will not be fought
tomorrow. Aristotle proposed solving this problem of *logical fatalism*
by denying that future contingent propositions have definite
truth-values.

Using the ‘$\Box$' for ‘it is necessary that', the principle that all
necessary truths are in fact 
$$
\Box \mathrm{P}\to \mathrm{P},\tag*{(\textbf{T})}
$$ {#eq-modal-axiom-T}
but adding its converse that all truths are necessary truths:
$$
\mathrm{P} \to \Box \mathrm{P} \tag*{(\textbf{V})}
$$ {#eq-modal-axiom-V}
collapses the notions of truth and necessary truth.

Medieval philosophers, concerned with such theological issues as
articulating the nature of the Trinity, appealed to such modal notions
as essence and accident, contingency and necessity in their labyrinthine
theological reflections.[^modal-2] Akin to the problem is logical fatalism is
the problem of *theological fatalism*: the problem of reconciling divine
foreknowledge and human freedom. Saint Augustine (354--430) in his
treatise *On the Free Choice of Will* considers an argument for
*theological fatalism* proposed by Evodius. Evodius argued that “God
foreknew that man would sin, that which God foreknew must necessarily
come to pass.” We may set forth this argument for theological fatalism
for a particular case as follows:

[^modal-2]: 
    The theological, if not the political, roots Great Schism of 1054,
    which can be traced back to a disagreement about the modalities of the
    Persons of the Trinity. The Nicean Creed (325) uses the term *homoousios*
    (from the Greek *homo* = ‘same‘ and *ousios* = ‘essence' or
    ‘substance'), in contrast to *homoiousios* (from the Greek *homoi* =
    ‘similar') making the solitary *i* the jot and tittle of Nicean Creedal
    Orthodoxy. The Greek Church preferred the latter term since the former
    had been used by the Syrian Bishop of Antioch to espouse *modal
    monarchism*, the heresy that the Heavenly Father, Resurrected Son and
    Holy Spirit are not three distinct Persons, but are rather
    different *modes* or *aspects* of one monadic God perceived by believers
    as distinct persons. The Latin Church adopted the former siding with
    Athanasius against the heretic Arius, who denied that Jesus was co-equal
    and co-eternal with the Father. The Second Council of Nicea (381), among
    other changes, inserted the word *filioque* (from the Latin *filio* =
    the son, and *que* = “and”) into the Nicean-Constantinopolitan Creed and
    the Latin mass. In Latin theology, the three Persons of the Trinity are
    logically distinguished by the formal relations of “proceeding from”
    citing such proof texts as Phil. 1:9, Titus 3:6, Acts 2:33. Orthodox
    theology, citing the words of Jesus in proof texts such John 15:26,
    regarded the insertion of *filioque* into the Nicean-Constantipolitan
    creed, is as Semi-Sabellianism. The great church historian @Pelikan1988melody [p.90]
    opined: “If there is a special circle of the inferno
    described by Dante reserved for historians of theology, the principal
    homework assigned to that subdivision of Hell for at least the first
    several eons of eternity may well be a thorough study of all the
    treatises… devoted to the inquiry: Does the Holy Spirit proceed from the
    Father only, as Eastern Christendom contends, or from both the Father
    and the Son as the Latin Church teaches?” In 1989 Pope John Paul II and
    Patriarch Demetrius knelt together in Rome and recited the Nicene Creed
    without the *filioque*.

- If God knew that Adam would sin, then, necessarily Adam sinned.

- Therefore, Adam necessarily sinned.
:::

St. Thomas Aquinas (1225--1274) in his *Summa Contra Gentiles* (part I,
chapter 67) criticized this kind of argument as resting on an amphiboly.
The critical first premise “if God knew Adam would sin, then,
*necessarily*, Adam sinned” is ambiguous between

then Adam will sin.
- [(1*b*)]{#eq-modal-1b} If God knows that Adam will sin, then it is necessary that Adam
will sin.
:::
\renewcommand\labelitemi{\labelitemito}

Aquinas called [(1*a*)](#eq-modal-1a) the *necessity of the consequence* contrasting it
with [(1*b*)](#eq-modal-1b) the *necessity of the consequent*. Using the ‘$\Box$' to
abbreviate ‘it is necessary that', the difference between these two can
be made more perspicuous with symbols:
$$
\Box (\mathrm{P} \to \mathrm{Q}) \tag*{(1\textit{a})}
$$ {#eq-modal-symbol-1a}
$$
(\mathrm{P} \to \Box \mathrm{Q}) \tag*{(1\textit{b})}
$$ {#eq-modal-symbol-1b}
Solving the famous theological problem of reconciling divine foreknowledge
with human freedom may turn on exposing ambiguities of this sort.

Perhaps the most famous theological application of modal logic is Saint
Anselm's modal ontological argument. According to Saint Anselm (1033--1109), 
it follows from God's nature that it is necessary that God exists
if God exists at all. Moreover, this conditional itself, being a
conceptual truth, is itself necessarily true. We then have the following
argument:

\renewcommand\labelitemi{}
::: {.nobullet}
- Necessarily, if God exists, then God necessarily exists.
- It is possible that God exists.
- Therefore, God (actually) exists.
:::
\renewcommand\labelitemi{\labelitemito}

Using ‘${\Large\diamond}$' for ‘it is possible that', the above argument can be
symbolized:
$$
\Box(G\to\Box G).\quad{\Large\diamond} G\quad\therefore G\tag*{(2)}
$$ {#eq-modal-2}

The question of whether Anselm's argument is valid became a precise
question when various systems of modal logic were proposed and developed
in the 1960s. 

Gottlob Frege (1848--1925), the inventor (or discoverer) of modern
predicate-quantifier logic, relegated modality to autobiographical
information about the speaker, and for many years logicians only
investigated extensional logic.

One of the most puzzling validities, at least to the beginning logical
students is known as *Lewis's Dilemma*:
$$\mathrm{P}\land\lnot \mathrm{P}\to \mathrm{Q},$$
which states *“a contradiction implies anything”*^[Or *"ex falso quodlibet"*, in Latin.]. 
This implication follows from the inference rules of simplification, addition, and *modus
tollendo ponens*^[*"mode that denies by affirming"*], which are themselves not particularly puzzling.

C. I. Lewis investigated modal logic in order to find a stricter form of
the conditional which would not result in such paradoxes. Lewis defined
*strict implication* $\mathrm{P}\Rightarrow \mathrm{Q}$ (read “$\mathrm{P}$ *strictly implies* $\mathrm{Q}$”) by combining
modality with the truth-functional conditional:
$$
\mathrm{P}\Rightarrow \mathrm{Q}\quad:=\quad\Box(\mathrm{P}\land\lnot \mathrm{Q}),
$$
or alternatively,
$$
\mathrm{P}\Rightarrow \mathrm{Q}\quad:=\quad\Box(\mathrm{P}\to \mathrm{Q}).
$$

The notion of strict implication was characterized by such axioms as:

The philosopher Leibniz (1646--1716) explicitly invoked that language
of possible worlds to explain the difference between necessary and
contingent truths. What is logically or necessarily true are those
truths truth in *all* possible worlds, whereas a contingent truth is one
that is true in *some* possible worlds.

Drawing upon this logical connection between universal and existential
quantification and the modal notions of necessity and possibility, we
obtain a modal version of the classical Aristotelian Square of
Opposition and the duality of modal laws known as the laws of modal
negation.

[An Aristotelian Diamond of Opposition]{.smallcaps}
:::

In the modern development of modal logic, logicians noticed that a host
other phenomena—such as deontic notions of obligation and
permissibility, epistemic notions of knowledge and belief, as well as
temporal operators—share these logical relations and hence can be
represented as modal logics.

In *deontic logic*, $\Box$ is read “it is morally obligatory that” and ${\Large\diamond}$ is
read “it is morally permissible that”. Kant's maxim that “ought implies
can”, that is, whatever is obligatory is permissible, is captured by
modal axiom [(**D**)](#eq-modal-axiom-D):
$$
\Box \mathrm{P} \to{\Large\diamond} \mathrm{P}.\tag*{(\textbf{D})}
$$ {#eq-modal-axiom-D}

In *epistemic logic*, $\Box$ is read for some subject $S$ “it is known that”
and ${\Large\diamond}$ is read “it is believed that”. Some modal axioms for epistemic
logic that have been considered include:

$$ {#eq-modal-axiom-E}
::::
\vspace{-1\parskip}

The axiom [(**K**)](#eq-modal-axiom-K) expresses logical omniscience insofar as this axiom
requires that the knowledge of an agent is closed under *modus ponens*;
and hence such knowers know all the logical consequences of their
knowledge.

Axiom [(**T**)](#eq-modal-axiom-T-2) states the truism that whatever is known is true. Notice
that this axiom would be too strong for deontic logic insofar as an
action's being obligatory doesn't imply that the agent actually performs
that action.

Axiom [(**4**)](#eq-modal-axiom-4) expresses a high degree of *positive introspective
knowledge*: if someone knows P, then she knows that she knows that $\mathrm{P}$.
Axiom [(**E**)](#eq-modal-axiom-E) on the other hand, expresses a high degree of *negative*
introspective knowledge: if someone doesn't know that $\mathrm{P}$, then he knows
he doesn't know $\mathrm{P}$. This axiom is contrary to the experience of Socrates:
as the gadfly of Athens, Socrates found through his questioning that
many of his fellow Athenians did not know what they were talking about
but also didn't know that they didn't know. The gadfly of Athens
believed his vocation was to sting his fellow Athenians into the
awareness they were own ignorance, a service for which they did not
always show adequate appreciation.

The *temporal logic* or Diodorian temporal logic was studied by the
logician A. N. Prior (1914--1969). To model temporal language, we
introduce a pair of modal operators for the future and a pair of modal
operators for the past.

The axioms for minimal tense logic include version of Axiom [(**K**)](#eq-modal-axiom-K) for
the two necessity operators:
\begin{align*}
&{\color{red}\Box}(\varphi\to\psi)\to({\color{red}\Box}\varphi\to{\color{red}\Box}\psi)

&\begin{aligned}\text{\textit{Whatever will always follow from what always will be,}}\\\text{\textit{always will be.}}\end{aligned}&
\tag*{(K${\color{green}\Box}$)}
\end{align*}

It also contains two axioms concerning the interaction of the past and
future that has the form of the so-called Brouwersche axiom with
alternating valences:
\begin{align*}
\tag*{(B${\color{green}\Box}{\color{red}{\Large\diamond}}$)}
&\varphi\to{\color{green}\Box}{\color{red}{\Large\diamond}}\varphi
&\text{\textit{What is, will always have been}}\\
\tag*{(B${\color{red}\Box}{\color{green}{\Large\diamond}}$)}
&\varphi\to{\color{red}\Box}{\color{green}{\Large\diamond}}\varphi
&\text{\textit{What is, has always been going to happen}}\\
\end{align*}

The Brouwersche [(**B**)](#eq-modal-axiom-B) axiom was so-named by the logician Oskar Becker
[@Becker1930Logik]
after the charismatic Dutch mathematician L. E. J. Brouwer (1881--1966), who championed a philosophy of mathematics known as
*intuitionism*. It happens that when the ${\Large\diamond}$ can be paraphrased as ${\Large\diamond}\lnot{\Large\diamond}$,
the resulting axiom has the form of the acceptable form of double
negation in intuitionistic logic:
$$
\varphi\to\lnot{\Large\diamond}\lnot{\Large\diamond}\varphi\tag*{(\textbf{B})}

## A Classical Theorem, but in Intuitionism

**Theorem.** There exist two irrational numbers $x$ and $y$ such that $x^y$ is irrational.

::: {.proof}
Consider
$$
\sqrt{2}^{\left(\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}\right)}
=\sqrt{2}^{\left(\sqrt{2}\cdot\sqrt{2}\right)}
=\sqrt{2}^2=2,
$$
which is rational.

\renewcommand\labelitemi{\labelitemito}
The number $\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}$ is either rational or irrational.

- If it's rational, then $x=y=\sqrt{2}$ are both irrational yet $x^y$ is rational.
- If $\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}$ is irrational, then $x=\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}$ and $y=\sqrt{2}$
  are both irrational and $x^y$ is rational.

Either way, there exists $x$ and $y$ such that $x^y$ is rational.
<span class="content-visible" style="float: right;" when-format="html">$\Box$</span>
:::

Intuitionists reject this classical argument by separation of cases because it does not 
actually construct the numbers $x$ and $y$ such that $xy$ is irrational.
The idea behind intuitionistic logic is that the connectives are reinterpreted as
involving a kind of provability.

In case you're curious, it is actually known that $\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}$ is irrational, due to the
[Gelfond--Schneider theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelfond\%E2\%80\%93Schneider_theorem)
which verifies that it usually take significantly more effort to convince an intuitionistic mathematicians than a classical one. 
::::
:::::

According to intuitionism, mathematical objects do not exist as eternal
Platonic objects but are constructions in intuition. Intuitionists read
the propositional connectives as involving not merely truth, but proof,
and so they rejected such classical forms of reasoning as *reductio ad
absurdum* and theorems such as the *law of excluded middle.*
Intuitionists reject the following mathematical proof.

Around the 1970s it was noticed that the famous incompleteness theorems
[@Godel1931Incomepleteness] were propositional in character and that their logic
could be captured in propositional modal logic. These modal provability
logics added to Axiom [(**K**)](#eq-modal-axiom-K) the following axiom, known
as the Gödel-Löb axiom or also the well-ordering axiom.
$$
\Box(\Box\varphi\to\varphi)\to\Box\varphi\tag*{(\textbf{W})}
$$ {#eq-modal-axiom-W}

*Modal Provability Logics* proliferated from the 1950s--1970s, but the
genesis of the idea goes back to a short note of @Godel1933 in
which he noted that intuitionistic truth is defined in terms of proof since
provability is a kind of necessity. The above axiom can be read as a
kind of soundness theorem.

\renewcommand\labelitemi{}

- *if it is provable that $\varphi$ being provable implies it is true, then $\varphi$ is
provable.*
:::
\renewcommand\labelitemi{\labelitemito}

Later we will show how to use a modal provability logic to exhibit the
propositional logic of key parts of Gödel's First and Second
Incompleteness Theorems.

In contemporary logic, modal logic has grown beyond these philosophical
origins and is at the interface of a number of disciplines including the
studies information flow and dynamics, game theory, and computability.

(@) Symbolize the following modal arguments.
    (A) Eratosthenes must either be in Syene or Alexandria. Eratosthenes
        cannot be in Syene. Therefore, Eratosthenes must be in Alexandria.
    (B) Assume that justice can be defined as paying your debts and telling
        the truth. Then it is *morally obligatory* for Cephalus to comply to
        a madman's request that Cephalus return a borrowed sword and that
        Cephalus tell the truth about the whereabouts of a friend whom
        the madman wants to kill with the sword. However, if this act is
        *morally obligatory*, then it is *morally permissible*. However, it
        is *morally impermissible* (or *morally forbidden*) for Cephalus to
        comply. So it isn't *morally obligatory* for Cephalus to comply.
        Justice, therefore, cannot be defined as paying your debts and
        telling the truth.
    (C) It is conceivable that I am having experiences qualitatively
        identical to those I am having now on the supposition that I am

## [Possible World Semantics]{.smallcaps}

The Leibnizian idea of characterizing necessity and possibility in terms
of truth in all or some possible worlds was given an elegant
formalization by [@Kripke1959; @Kripke1963] when he was only a teenager.
According to Leibniz, a sentence is *necessary* if it is true in *every*
possible world, and a sentence is *possible* if it is true is *some*
possible world. Kripke showed that by placing very natural conditions on
a relation of *relative possibility* or *accessibility* on a set of
possible worlds, the various systems of modal logic could be validated.

Intuitively, a possible world tells us for each sentence letter whether
it is true or false in that world. Stripping away inessentials, we can
represent a possible world by a subset of sentence letters. A *modal
structure* $\mathbb{M}$ is an ordered triple $\langle W, R,\alpha \rangle$, where $W$ is a
set^[set-theoretic size issues‽] of possible worlds, $R\subseteq W\times W$ is a relation known as the
*accessibility relation* or the *relative possibility relation*, and $\alpha$
is a distinguished element of *W* known as the *actual world*.

We can exhaustively characterize the notion of
$$\beta \vDash \varphi,$$
the *truth of a sentence in a possible world* $\beta$, by

(@) If $\varphi$ is a sentence letter S, then
$$
\beta\vDash S \iff S\in\beta,
$$
i.e. $S$ is a member of $\beta$;

(@) If $\varphi$ is $\psi$, then 
$$
\beta\vDash \neg\psi \iff \beta\not\vDash\psi,
$$
i.e., it is not the case that $\beta\vDash\psi$;

(@) (a) If $\varphi$ is $(\psi\land\chi)$, then 
    $$
    \beta\vDash (\psi\land\chi) \iff \beta\vDash\psi \mathrel{\&} \beta\vDash\chi,
    $$
    i.e., both $\beta\vDash\psi$ and $\beta\vDash\chi$;
    
    (b) If $\varphi$ is $(\psi\lor\chi)$, then 
    $$
    \beta\vDash (\psi\lor\chi) \iff \beta\vDash\psi \mathrel{\|} \beta\vDash\chi,
    $$
    i.e., either $\beta\vDash\psi$ or $\beta\vDash\chi$, or both;
    
    (c) If $\varphi$ is $(\psi\to\chi)$, then 
    $$
    \beta\vDash (\psi\to\chi) \iff \beta\vDash\psi\implies\chi,
    $$
    i.e., if $\beta\vDash\psi$ then $\beta\vDash\chi$, or either $\beta\not\vDash\psi$ or $\beta\vDash\chi$ ‽;
    
    (d) If $\varphi$ is $(\psi\leftrightarrow\chi)$, then 
    $$
    \beta\vDash (\psi\leftrightarrow\chi) \iff \beta\vDash\psi\iff\chi,
    $$
    i.e., $\beta\vDash\psi$ if and only if $\beta\vDash\chi$;

Finally, the law clause gives the Leibnizian truth conditions for
necessity and possibility:

(@) (a) If $\varphi$ is $\Box\psi$, then 
    $$
    \beta\vDash \Box\psi \iff \forall \gamma\in W.\, \beta\mathrel{R}\gamma \implies \beta\vDash\psi,
    $$
    i.e., $\psi$ is true in *all* possible worlds $\gamma$, possible-relative to $\beta$;
    
    (b) If $\varphi$ is ${\Large\diamond}\psi$, then 
    $$
    \beta\vDash {\Large\diamond}\psi \iff \exists \gamma\in W.\, \beta\mathrel{R}\gamma \implies \beta\vDash\psi,
    $$
    i.e., $\psi$ is true in some possible worlds $\gamma$, possible-relative to $\beta$;

This completes the definition of truth in a model for modal
propositional logic. Using this definition of truth, we can now define
what it means for a sentence to be *semantically valid*:
$$
\vDash\varphi\text{ (i.e., }\varphi\text{ is semantically valid)} \iff \forall\alpha\in W.\, \alpha\vDash\varphi.
$$

Next, we obtain different systems of modal logic when various conditions
are placed on the accessibility or relative possibility relation R. We
say that a relation $R$ is a *series* if $R$ is serial; $R$ is a *reflexivity*
if $R$ is totally reflexive; $R$ is a *similarity* if $R$ is totally reflexive
and symmetric; $R$ is a *partial ordering* if $R$ is totally reflexive and
transitive; $R$ is an *equivalence relation* if $R$ is totally reflexive and
euclidean. It turns out that the axioms of modal logic discussed above
are validated when natural conditions are imposed on the accessibility
or relative possibility relation $R$.

Properties of Accessibility

:::

Systems of modal logic are *normal* when everything derivable from
necessary truths is itself necessary. This will be the case if the
rule of *modus ponens* and axiom [(**K**)](#eq-modal-axiom-K-2) are valid:
$$
\Box(\mathrm{P}\to \mathrm{Q})\to(\Box \mathrm{P}\to\Box \mathrm{Q}).\tag*{(\textbf{K})}
$$ {#eq-modal-axiom-K-2}

Axiom **K** expresses the intuition that *necessary truths imply only
necessary truths*.

We can conveniently summarize the above systems of modal logic in a
chart. The various modal systems can be characterized by the axioms that
are valid in them. The smallest normal modal logic system **K**
contains axiom **K**.
The four most famous modal logics are system (T) named
after the Gödel--Feyes--von Wright modal logic to model tautologies,
system **S4** and **S5**, named after C. I. Lewis's axioms for strict
implications, and the unduly neglected Brouwersche system **B**, named by
Becker after the intuitionist L. E. J. Brouwer due to the characteristic
axiom's similarity to intuitionistic double negation. All these systems
contain **K** and **T**.
The system **D** is a weaker system than
**T**, containing axioms **K** and **D**,
is named for deontic logic.

Notice that relationships of containment among the modal systems follow
from the logic of relations. Axiom **B** requires that R be symmetric
and **4** requires that R be transitive. System **S5** with axioms **T**
and **E** require R to be an equivalence relation (i.e., reflexive,
symmetric, and transitive); hence, **S5** could also be specified by
requiring axioms **T**, **4**, and **B** to be valid. Therefore, **S5**
contains **S4** and **B**, neither of which contains the other. Systems
**S5**, **S4** and **B** all contain system **T**, which contains **D**.

A convenient way of describing these modal logics is by their *Lemmon
code* listing the axioms valid in them. For example,
$\mathbf{S5} = \mathbf{KTE} = \mathbf{KT4B} = \mathbf{KD4B}$.
We can represent these containment relations in a
diagram in which downward paths represent containment.

Hasse--Picassos Diagrams for Systems of Modal Logic

One way to visualize how the conditions on the accessibility relation
validate their respective axioms is using the definitions of '$\small\square$' and $\LARGE\diamond$ in
terms of possible worlds and use directed graphs from Chapter IV to
represent the accessibility relation $\mathbin{R}$. Here the accessibility relation
$\alpha\mathbin{R}\beta$ (read "$\beta$ is possible relative to $\alpha$""
or "$\beta$ is accessible to $\alpha$") is
represented by an arrow from a circle representing possible world $\alpha$ to a
circle representing possible world $\beta$.

Accessibility Represented by Directed Graphs

:::

We can, using the directed graphs from the theory of relations,
translate properties of accessibility relations into geometric
properties of directed graphs. Symmetry, for example, requires that all
accessibility arrows are double arrows. Reflexivity requires that every
world be accessible to itself and so every world has a loop, which is a
special case of a double arrow. Seriality requires that every world is a
tail of an arrow. Transitivity requires that for every indirect path of
accessibility from $\alpha$ to $\beta$ and from $\beta$ to $\gamma$, there is a direct path from $\alpha$
to $\gamma$. Being euclidean and serial is equivalent to being an equivalence
relation, that is, being reflexive, symmetric and transitive.
Expressing $\mathbin{R}$ in terms of love and worlds in terms of persons, we have
the following intuitive translations:

::: {#tbl-relational-properties-of-directed-graphs}

| | | |
|---|---|---|
|  serial  |  $\forall \alpha.\,\exists \beta.\, \alpha \mathbin{R} \beta$  | Everyone is a lover. |

|  symmetric  |  $\forall \alpha.\, \forall \beta.\, (\alpha \mathbin{R} \beta \Rightarrow \beta \mathbin{R} \alpha)$  | All love is requited; all love is mutual. |

|  euclidean  |  $\forall \alpha.\, \forall \beta.\, \forall \gamma.\, (\alpha \mathbin{R} \beta \;\&\; \alpha \mathbin{R} \gamma \Rightarrow \beta \mathbin{R} \gamma)$  | All beloveds of the same lover, love each other and themselves. |

Relational Properties of Directed Graphs 

:::

Using the definition of truth in a modal system set forth above, we can
rigorously demonstrate that if R is transitive, then axiom **4** is
valid. This demonstration is carried out in the meta-language. We use
the symbols '$\forall$', ‘$\exists$', ‘$\&$', ‘$\implies$' and ‘$\in$' in the meta-language for
‘all', ‘some', ‘and', ‘if… then', and ‘is an element of', respectively.
Once the truth clauses are unpacked, the logical demonstration is no
more complicated than a derivation in the theory of relations.

Kaplan Semantic Derivation of Transitivity Validating Axiom 4

:::
\phantom{a}

The above semantic derivation can be visualized graphically to prove the
above result contrapositively. We will show that if
$${\small\square}\varphi\to{\small\square}{\small\square}\varphi$$
is false, then the accessibility relation cannot be transitive. Axiom
(4) fails when its antecedent $\varphi$ is true but its consequent ${\small\square}\varphi$ is
false in α. By modal negation, $\neg{\Large\diamond}{\Large\diamond}\varphi$ is equivalent to ${\Large\diamond}{\Large\diamond}\neg\varphi$.

So both ${\small\square}\varphi$ and ${\Large\diamond}{\Large\diamond}\neg\varphi$ are true in some possible world $\alpha$.
Eliminating the first ${\Large\diamond}$, we have that in some possible world $\beta$ accessible to $\alpha$ (i.e. $\alpha\mathbin{R}\beta$), ${\Large\diamond}\neg\varphi$
is true. Applying the definition of truth for ${\LARGE\diamond}$ again, we have that for
some world $\gamma$ accessible to $\beta$ (i.e. $\beta\mathbin{R}\gamma$), $\neg\varphi$ is true in $\gamma$.
Notice that the
transitivity of the accessibility relation $R$ would require that $\gamma$ be
accessible to $\alpha$, which would contradict that ${\small\square}\varphi$.
The invalidity of Axiom (**4**) implies the failure of the transitivity of the accessibility
relation $R$. Stating this result contrapositively, if the accessibility
relation $R$ is transitive, then axiom (**4**) is valid.

Kripke--Mar Diagram for Transitivity of $R$ Validating Axiom (4)

:::

The semantic demonstration together with the graphic proof using
directed graphs support one another in building our intuitions for modal
logic. The graphic proofs are satisfying because of their simplicity and
ability to make the critical step visually perspicuous. On the other
hand, the semantic proof is satisfying insofar as the explicit
definitions of $\small\square$, $\LARGE\diamond$, $\vDash$ are shown to work elegantly and precisely with
our natural deduction systems using the quantifier logic with UD, UI,
EI, EG and the theory of relations. We will use the directed graphs in
the context of discovering new axioms and the semantic proofs in the
context of justifying that these axioms correspond to imposing
requirements on the accessibility relation.
