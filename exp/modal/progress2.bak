1.  R is the relative possibility or accessibility relation in a modal
    system. First construct a graphic demonstration to discover the
    logical key that unlocks the relationship between the validity of an
    axiom and its corresponding accessibility relation, and then provide
    rigorous semantic derivation to justify your discovery.

    1.  If R is a serial, then axiom (**D)** is valid.

An intriguing philosophical application of R is *symmetric* ⇒ ⊨ (ϕ → ϕ)
is a modal ontological argument, which we state in a weaker form that is
possible.

> (G → G) . G ∴ G

Let’s read  is “it is conceivable that” and  as “it is conceptually
necessary that”. Then the first premise can be translated: “It is
conceptually necessary that if God exists, then it is necessary that God
exists.” The intuitive philosophical idea is that God’s existence, like
the existence of numbers, couldn’t be accidental: if God exists at all,
then God’s existence is not contingent but necessary. Moreover, this
conditional itself is a conceptual truth. Then if it is even
conceivable, i.e., conceptually possible that God exists, then God
actually exists!

How can it be that purely conceptual premises logically imply the actual
existence of God? Is there an “intuitionistic” sleight of mind going on
here? It happens that modal axiom (**B**) is what is required to
validate this argument. Use a semantic diagram to see why this is the
case!

2\. There are different axiomatizations for different philosophical
conception of time. According to the *tensed theory of time* championed
by the philosopher C. D. Broad, the past is real and the present moves
up the tree of possible futures turning the unreal future into the real
past. Another theory, due to A. N. Prior, known as *presentism*, holds
that only the present is real and the past and the future are unreal.
What do the following axioms express about the structure of time?

(D<sub>1</sub>) <sub>F</sub> <sub>F</sub> ϕ → <sub>F</sub> ϕ
*transitivity* ∀*x* &lt; *t* ∀*y* &lt; *x*: *y* &lt; *t*

(D<sub>2</sub>) <sub>F</sub> ϕ → <sub>G</sub>(<sub>P</sub> ϕ ∨ ϕ ∨
<sub>F</sub>ϕ) *future-linearity* ∀*x*∀*y*(*y* &lt; *x* → ∀*z*(R*xz* →
*y* &lt; *z*))

(D<sub>3</sub>) <sub>P</sub> **⊤** *regress into past* ∀*t* ∃*x* *x*
&lt; *t*

(D<sub>4</sub>) <sub>P</sub> ϕ → <sub>P</sub> ϕ *necessity of the past*

Premise D<sub>2</sub> corresponds to the condition of
*future-linearity*, namely, that all times future to a moment of time
are comparable to a past moment of that time. The argument is valid
because this premise implies the reduction of modality to temporality:

ϕ → (<sub>P</sub> ϕ ∨ ϕ ∨ <sub>F</sub> ϕ) .

What properties of time to the following axioms express?

<sub>F</sub> **⊤**

<sub>P</sub> **⊤**

<sub>F</sub> <sub>F</sub> ϕ → <sub>F</sub> ϕ

<sub>P</sub> <sub>P</sub> ϕ → <sub>P</sub> ϕ

<sub>F</sub> ϕ → <sub>F</sub> <sub>F</sub> ϕ

<sub>P</sub> ϕ → <sub>P</sub> <sub>P</sub> ϕ

ϕ → <sub>F</sub> <sub>H</sub>(ϕ ∨ <sub>F</sub> ϕ)

<sub>F</sub> ϕ ∧ <sub>F</sub> ψ → <sub>F</sub> (ϕ ∧ ψ) ∨ <sub>F</sub> (ϕ
∧ <sub>F</sub> ψ) ∨ <sub>F</sub> (<sub>F</sub> ϕ ∧ ψ)

<sub>P</sub> ϕ ∧ <sub>P</sub> ψ → <sub>P</sub> (ϕ ∧ ψ) ∨ <sub>P</sub> (ϕ
∧ <sub>P</sub> ψ) ∨ (<sub>P</sub> (<sub>P</sub> ϕ ∧ ψ)

*unending future* ∀*x*∃*y* *x* &lt; *y*

*past successors* ∀*x*∃*y* *y* &gt; *x*

*future transitivity* ∀*x*∀*y*∀*z* (*x* &lt; *y* &lt; *z* → *x* &lt;

*past transitivity* ∀*x*∀*y*∀*z* (*x* &gt; *y* &gt; *z* → *x* &gt; *z*)

3\. Prior’s axiomatization of temporal logic known as the *Diodorean
System* consists of **KT4** and the following axiom **Dum** (named after
the philosopher Michael Dummett, a champion of intuitionism). Give a
reading of his axiom in temporal logic:

> ((P→P)→P)→ (P →P) .

4\. Demonstrate that the following axioms require the corresponding
conditions on R.

</tbody>
</table>

Formulate each of the conditions on R in terms of a directed graph. Then
demonstrate that if each of the axioms is assumed to be invalid, then
the corresponding condition on R must fails to hold.

5\. An elegant result due to Lemmon and Scott (1977) states a
correspondence between conditions on R and axioms of the generalized
form:

*<sup>hi</sup>*ϕ → *<sup>j</sup>**<sup>k</sup>*ϕ .

Here *<sup>m</sup>* and *<sup>n</sup>* represents *m* diamonds and *n*
boxes in a row, respectively. The corresponding condition on R imposed
by the generalized axiom is given by

R*<sup>h</sup>*αβ & R*<sup>j</sup>*αγ ⇒ ∃η(R*<sup>i</sup>*βη &
R*<sup>k</sup>*γη) .

Here the *composition* R ° S of two relations R and S (in symbols, R °
S) can be defined as

R ° S αβ =<sub>df</sub> ∃γ(Rαγ & Sγβ) .

For example, if R is the relation *being a sister of* and S is the
relation *being a parent of*, then the composition of the relations R
<sub>°</sub> S is the relation *being* *an aunt of*, that is

R ° S αβ ↔ ∃γ(Rαγ & Sγβ) .

If R is the relation *being a parent of*, then R <sub>°</sub> R = R
<sup>2</sup> is the relation *being a grandparent of*, and R
<sub>°</sub> R <sub>°</sub> R = R<sup>3</sup> is the relation *being a
great-grandparent of*. R<sup>0</sup> is the *identity relation*, i.e.,
R<sup>0</sup>αβ if and only if α = β, and R <sup>1</sup> = R.

Verify that the values for *h, i, j, k* as indicated in the chart yield
the standard axioms, and that the standard condition on R for each of
the axioms is equivalent to the one specified by the Lemmon-Scott
Generalized Correspondence theorem:

5\. Another interpretation of the ‘’ is provability. The *Gödel-Löb
Provability System* is the system **K4W,** where the **(W)** axiom (here
‘W’ stands for “well-ordering”) is as follows:

(**W**) (ϕ → ϕ) → ϕ .

Give an informal argument to show that (**W**) requires the
accessibility relation to be transitive, irreflexive, and *finite*
(i.e., indirect paths of R chains terminate in a *finite* number of
steps.) It is interesting to note that being ‘finite’ cannot be
expressed in a sentence of first-order logic. This follows from the
compactness meta-theorem that states that any infinite set of sentences
that is finitely satisfiable (i.e., any finite subset has a model) must
also be satisfiable (i.e., there is a model that satisfies the entire
infinite set).

First we list the *characteristic axioms* for various modal systems.

> T538 P → P Axiom (**D**)
>
> T560 P → P Axiom (**T**)
>
> T570 P → P Axiom (**B**)
>
> T580 P → P Axiom (**4**)
>
> T590 P → P Axiom (**5**)

Next we list some theorem common to all the modal systems we have been
discussing. T501 and T502 state *modal derivation* *principles*. T501,
known as axiom (K**)** (after Kripke), expresses the principle that
justifies strict derivation in the form of necessity derivation:
whatever is entailed by a necessary truth is necessary. T502 is the
basis for possibility derivation: whatever is logically entailed by
something possible is itself possible.

> T501 (P → Q) → (P → Q)
>
> T502 (P → Q) → (P → Q)

Theorems T503-T506 express the *laws of modal negation*:

> T503 ~ P ↔ ~ P
>
> T504 ~ P ↔ ~ P
>
> T505 P ↔ ~~P
>
> T506 P ↔ ~~ P

In addition to T501 and T502 above, T507-T520 state *laws of modal
distribution* that are valid in all systems of normal modal logic.

> T507 (P ∨ Q) ↔ P ∨ Q
>
> T508 (P ∧ Q) ↔ P ∧ Q
>
> T509 (P ∧ Q) → P ∧ Q
>
> T510 P ∨ Q → (P ∨ Q)
>
> T511 (P → Q) → (P → Q)

T512 (P → Q) → (P → Q)

> T513 (P ↔ Q) → (P ↔ Q)

T514 (P ↔ Q) → (P ↔ Q)

> T515 ~ P → ~ P

T516 (P ∨ Q) → P ∨ Q

> T517 ~P → ~P
>
> T518 (P → Q) → (P → Q)
>
> T519 (P → Q) → (P → Q)

T520 (P → Q) → (P → Q)

> T521 (~P ∧ Q) → (~P ∧ Q)

The following theorems are modal counterparts to *consequentia
mirabilis*:

T522 (~P → P) ↔ P

> T523 (~P → P) ↔ P
>
> T524 (P → ~P) ↔ ~P
>
> T525 (P → ~P) ↔ ~P
>
> T526 (P → ~P) ↔ ~P
>
> T527 (~P → P) ↔ P

Analogues to theorems T229 and T230 in monadic quantifier logic (which
we may call the “Drinking Theorems” after a joke by Smullyan) are
(**T)** theorems despite the nested modal operators:

T529 (P → P)

T530 (P → P)

Corresponding to quantifier theorems T234 − T247 are the modal theorems
T534 − T547. Theorems T533 and T535 state principles—*transitivity* and
*strengthening*—that hold for strict implications but which do not hold
for *counterfactual conditionals* (that is, conditionals of the form,
*if it were the case that* P*, then it would be the case that* Q).

T533 (P → Q) → (P ∧ R → Q)

T534 \[(P → Q) ∧ (Q→ R) → (P → R)\]

T535 (P → Q) ∧ (Q → R) → (P → R)

T536 (P ↔ Q) ∧ (Q ↔ R) → (P ↔ R)

T537 (P → Q) ∧ (P → R) → (P → Q ∧ R)

T538 P → P

T539 (P ∧ Q) → (P ∧ Q)

T540 (P → Q) ∧ (P ∧ R) → (Q ∧ R)

T541 (P → Q ∨ R) → (P → Q) ∨ (P ∧ R)

Theorems T542 − T547 concern *strict implication*. T544 states the
equivalence of two characterizations of strict implication.

T542 ~(P → Q) ↔ (P ∧ ~Q)

T543 ~(P ∧ Q) ↔ (P → ~ Q)

T544 (P → Q) ↔ ~(P ∧ ~Q)

T545 ~P ↔ (P → Q) ∧ (P → ~Q)

T546 ~P ∧ ~Q → (P ↔ Q)

T547 (P → Q) ↔ (P → Q)

Although C. I. Lewis’s axioms of *strict implication* were introduced to
overcome the paradoxes of material implication, theorems T548-T552 are
corresponding *paradoxes of strict implication*:

T548 ~(P → Q) → P

T549 ~(P → Q) → ~Q

> T550 Q → (P → Q)
>
> T551 ~P → (P → Q)
>
> T552 (P → Q) ∨ (Q → P)

Next we list theorems for the various modal systems. T538, the
characteristic axiom for the modal system (**D),** is followed by other
theorems of that system**.**

T538 P → P

> T553 P ∨ ~P
>
> T554 ~(P ∧ ~P)
>
> T555 (P → ~Q) → (P → ~Q)

T560, the characteristic axiom for system (**T),** is followed by its
logical dual T561, other theorems of that system.

T560 P → P

> T561 P → P

> T562 (P → P)

>
> T564 P → P
>
> T565 P → P
>
> T566 P → P
>
> T567 P → P

T570, the characteristic axiom for system (**B),** is followed by its
logical dual T571, other theorems of that system. Theorems T573 and T574
are valid in **KB**, that is, their proofs do not require NI as an
inference rule, but only NI and ◊R as admissible strict importation
rules. Theorems T576 and T577 are related to Anselmian arguments
discussed in the introduction that can be validated using (**B)**.

T570 P → P

> T571 P → P

> T572 P → ~~P
>
> T573 (P → Q) → (P → Q)
>
> T574 (P → Q) → (P → Q)
>
> T575 P → P

T576 (P → P) ∧ P → P

T577 (P → P) ∧ P → P

T580, the characteristic theorem of system **S4**, is followed by its
logical dual T581 and other theorems of system **S4** (also known as
**KT4**). Theorems T582 − T584 are valid in **K4**, that is, they do not
require NI as an inference rule but only NI and R as admissible strict
importation rules. Theorems T585 and T586 are the *modal reductions
laws* for (**S4)**: one may collapse any string of iterated uniform
operators to a single occurrence of that operator.

> T581 P → P

> T582 (P → Q) → (P → Q)

> T583 (P ∨ Q) → (P ∨ Q)
>
> T584 ((P → Q) → R) → ((P→Q) → R)
>
> T585 P ↔ P
>
> T586 P ↔ P

Theorem T587 established that the (**G)** schema is valid in any normal
**KB** system. T588 is an alternative basis for (**S4)**.

> T587 P → P

T588 (P → Q) → (P → Q)

Theorems T590−T595 are theorems of the system (**S5)** (also known as
**KT5**). T590 is the characteristic theorem of the system, and T571 is
its logical dual. Theorems T592−T598 are valid in **K5**, that is, they
do not require NI as an inference rule, but they may employ NI, R, and
◊R as admissible strict importation rules. Theorems T599−T590 are valid
in any normal **K5** system.

>
> T609 P ↔ P
>
> T610 P ↔ P

Theorems T611−T612 are the additional *modal reduction laws* for **S5**.
These modal reduction laws together with the modal reduction laws T585
and T586 for (**S4)**, which also hold in **(S5)**, imply that iterated
modalities collapse to the innermost operator.

7\. Prove that if a relation R is reflexive, then R is euclidean if and
only if R is both symmetric and transitive, that is prove the following
theorem:

∀*x*R*xx* ⇒ (∀*u*∀*t*∀*v*(R*ut* & R*uv* ⇒ R*tv*) ⇔ \[∀*x*∀*y*(R*xy* ⇒
R*yx*) & ∀*x*∀*y*∀*z*(R*xy* & R*yz* ⇒ R*xz*)\]) .

8\. For each of the following pairs of statements, one is a theorem in
**T**, but the other is not. If a statement is a theorem, construct a
**T**-derivation of its conclusion from its premises. If statement is
not a theorem, provide an invalidating semantic diagram.

> \(A\) (P → Q) → (P → Q) ; (P → Q) → (P → Q)
>
> \(B\) (P ∧ Q) → (P ∧ Q) ; (P ∧ Q) → (P ∧ Q)

9\. Construct a semantic diagram and a semantic derivation in our
metalanguage to show that the axiom

(P → Q) ∨ (Q → P)

is valid in any modal structure in which the accessibility relation R is
*weakly connected*, i.e.,

∀*x*∀*y*∀*z*(R*xy* & R*xz* ⇒ R*yz* **∨** R*zy*) .

10\. Prove the following theorems about strict implication and strict
equivalence in system (**T**) to which we add the following deductive
rules:

*Strict Implication* \[SI\]: From P ⇒ Q to infer (P → Q), and
conversely.

*Strict Equivalence* \[SE\]: From P ⇔ Q to infer (P ↔ Q), and
conversely.

\(A\) ~(P ∧ ~Q) ↔ (P ⇒ Q)

\(B\) (P ⇒ Q) ∧ (P ⇒ ~Q) ⇒ Q

\(C\) (~P ∧ ~Q) ⇒ (P ⇔ Q)

\(D\) Q ∴ P ⇒ Q

\(E\) ~P ∴ P ⇒ Q

11\. A statement P is *contingent* if it is neither necessary nor
impossible. We may define the *contingency operator* ∇ as follows:

∇P ↔ ~(P ∨ ~P) .

Translate the following axioms about contingency into English, and then,
using the above definition, provide derivations of each of them in
**S5** in which you may use both Interchange of Equivalences (IE) and
biconditional derivation (BD).

> \(A\) ∇P ↔ ∇~P
>
> \(B\) ~∇(P ↔ Q) → (∇P → ∇Q)
>
> \(C\) ∇(P → Q) → (~∇P → P)
>
> \(D\) ~∇(P → ∇Q)
>
> \(E\) P ↔ (P ∧ ~∇P)
