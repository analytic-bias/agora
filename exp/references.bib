  abstract = {"The development of Maxim Kontsevich's initial ideas on motivic integration has unexpectedly influenced many other areas of mathematics, ranging from the Langlands program over harmonic analysis, to non-Archimedean analysis, singularity theory and birational geometry. This book assembles the different theories of motivic integration and their applications for the first time, allowing readers to compare different approaches and assess their individual strengths. All of the necessary background is provided to make the book accessible to graduate students and researchers from algebraic geometry, model theory and number theory. Applications in several areas are included so that readers can see motivic integration at work in other domains. In a rapidly-evolving area of research this book will prove invaluable. This first volume contains introductory texts on the model theory of valued fields, different approaches to non-Archimedean geometry, and motivic integration on algebraic varieties and non-Archimedean spaces"--},
