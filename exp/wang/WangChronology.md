<td><p>Born Wang Hao, 王浩 to a family of intellectuals in Jinan,
Shandong Province, China. Wang learned from his parents both Chinese
tradition and modern European-American approaches to science, art, and
politics brought about by Sun Yat-sen’s Revolution of (1911–12) that
overthrew the Qing (or Manchu) dynasty and created the Republic of
China.</p>
<p>Wang grew up during the “Post-May Fourth Movement in China.” (Wang’s
phrase in [1993]), which arose from disillusionment with the Chinese
Republic and traditional Chinese culture to protect China from
imperialism.</p></td>
<td><p>The May Fourth Movement (1919) anti-imperialist movement grows
out of student protests in Beijing against China’s treatment in the
Treat of Versailles. In 1925 the Kuomintang party (KMT) is formed and
engages in a civil war against the insurgent Chinese Communist
Party.</p>
<p>The legacy of the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act, the first immigration
law in U.S. history to target a group by race and class for exclusion,
is extended to discriminatory naturalization laws, e.g., the <em>Cable
Act</em> (1922) which stripped American women of citizenship if they
married a Chinese noncitizen, an “alien ineligible to
citizenship.”</p></td>

were American citizens, into ten internment camps in desolate parts of
