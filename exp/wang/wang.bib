This article uncovers these only gradually. A central question is then what, if anything, unifies them. Though early discussions are often muddy on the concepts and their employment, in a number of important respects they set the stage for the further developments, and so this article gives them special attention. Note that, ahistorically, modern logical and set-theoretical notation are used throughout, as long as it does not conflict with original intentions.}",

This was overshadowed by Hilbert’s program for finitist foundations via formal consistency proofs and Brouwer’s program for the “intuitionistic” constructive redevelopment of mathematics, both of which eventually met serious problems. Modern logical work has made it possible to give considerable substance to Weyl’s program, showing it to be surprisingly viable for scientifically applicable mathematics.}",
