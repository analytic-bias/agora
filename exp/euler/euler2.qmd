# Euler’s Elegant Identity $e^{i\pi}+1=0$ --- a mathematical mystery tour

## The Elegance of Euler’s Identity

In 1749 Euler set forth in his *Introduction in Analysis Infinitorum* an
identity considered to be among the most elegant in all of mathematics:
$$e^{i\pi}+1=0.$$
Euler’s equations, succinctly and elegantly combines five of the most
fundamental constants of mathematics.

Euler’s equation conceptually links numbers from three different number
systems (the natural, real, and complex numbers) using three of the most
fundamental arithmetic operations (addition, multiplication, and
exponentiation.) Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777 - 1855), the "Prince of
Mathematicians," reportedly said that anyone to whom Euler’s identity
was not immediately apparent would never become a first-class
mathematician.

Euler’s identity, it must be admitted, appears to be the work of a
magician. However, whether or not one aspires to become a first-class
mathematician, it is not immediately apparent how Euler’s equation even
makes sense.

*Exponentiation* is typically explained in terms of a repeated
multiplication. For example, the number 2 raised to the exponent 3 is
defined as the product of 2 multiplied by itself three times:
$$2^3=2\times2\times2=8.$$

Euler’s identity uses transcendental numbers with exponentiation. The
transcendental number $\pi$ is defined as the ratio of the circumference to
the diameter of a circle. Like the irrational number the $\sqrt{2}$, it is
represented by an infinite non-periodic decimal; however, unlike, such
*algebraic* irrational numbers, π is not the solution or root of any
polynomial such as $x^2-2=0$. The transcendental number
*e* is defined as the base of an exponential function whose rate of
change, or derivative, is equal to itself. In other words,
$e^x$ is the unique function such that it is its own
derivative.

Now the transcendental numbers *e* and π are numbers in the neighborhood
of the natural numbers 2 and 3, respectively, so it makes sense to think
of exponentiation as purely numerical functions. (To remember the digits
of π remember the question: *"May I have a large container of coffee
right now?"* and "*To express $e$ remember to remember a sentence to
remember this".*) Thinking of exponentiation as a function of real
numbers, we can compute:
$${2.7182818284\cdots}^{3.141592653\cdots} = 23.14069262\cdots.$$

However, Euler’s identity also includes an exponential factor of the
imaginary number $i$, where $i$ is defined to be the positive square
root of – 1. Now $i$ called *imaginary* number because no real number
can be the root of a negative number. Real numbers are either positive
or negative, and a positive number times a positive is positive and a
negative number times a negative is also positive. Euler in his
*Algebra* (1770) wrote:

> All such expressions as $\sqrt{-1},\ \sqrt{-2}$, etc., are
> consequently impossible or imaginary numbers, since they represent
> roots of negative quantities, and of such numbers we may truly assert
> that they are neither nothing, nor greater than nothing, nor less than
> nothing, which necessarily constitutes them imaginary or impossible.

Obviously, there must be some meaningful mathematical way of thinking of
exponentiation other than as a real-valued function.

The Nobel physicist Richard P. Feynman called Euler’s equation "our
jewel" and "the most remarkable formula in mathematics."
^[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_formula#cite_note-2]
Feynman recounts how he, as a young boy, was fascinated and in his
notebooks figured out for himself, rather than taking it on authority,
the mystery of why Euler’s identity was true. In Feynman’s spirit of
discovery, let’s take a mathematical journey in which we figure out the
meaning of Euler’s remarkable identity for ourselves—not being content
with mere proofs but instead taking the time to demystify the elements
of Euler’s beautiful equation.

The remarkable beauty of Euler’s derivation of his identity derives not
only from its deep *connections* of five fundamental mathematical
constants, but also how it illustrates the *cognitive* strategies
mathematicians deploy they are creating or discovering mathematical
truths. The last phrase "creating or discovering mathematical truths"
poses an important philosophical question: do mathematicians discover
mathematical truths or do they creatively construct them?

On this magical mystery tour, we will discover that mathematics is more
than merely crunching numbers, that it is more than presenting formal
proofs, and that mathematics involves such creative discoveries as:

-   *constructing* new number systems to solve previously impossible
    equations;
-   *discovering* in geometric representations higher-level
    *symmetries*;
-   *transforming* anomalous *singularities* into *systematic closure
    properties*;
-   *generalizing* arithmetic operations by *expanding* their
    mathematical meanings;
-   *unifying* conceptual domains by making bold conjectural
    *identifications*.

In demystifying Euler’s equation, our goal is not to dispel its beauty.
Indeed, by taking the time to understand how mathematicians create, we
will finally come to appreciate—in a mathematically precise rather than
a mystically vague way—the true beauty of Euler’s equation.

## A Concise, but Conceptually Incomplete, Proof

> ---[Benjamin Peirce (1809-1880)]{.smallcaps}

The Harvard mathematician Benjamin Peirce, father of the pragmatist
philosopher C. S. Peirce (1839-1914), is reported to have made the above
remark after proving Euler’s identity. This quotation reminds me of a
joke told by Raymond Smullyan. A mathematics professor, teaching a class
of mystified undergraduates, is writing a proof on the board and claims
that the theorem is "trivial." A brave student asks why the proof is
trivial. The professor turns back to the board and is lost in thought
for five minutes, and then announces, "aha, yes, it is trivial!" Too
often in a typical mathematics class, the lectures consist of presenting
proofs to silent, of silenced, students
^["Lecturing is the process of the transfer of knowledge from the notepad of the instructor to the notepads of the students, without ever touching the brains of either; that's atrocious." ---Chas, M. (2023)]
are left on their own to figure
out what is going on mathematically by doing exercises.

Perhaps the students are silent because they are afraid to "look stupid"
or perhaps they have learned that asking questions can be dangerous.
When some student asks the professor to explain some step of the proof,
perhaps the professor "explains" the proof by merely repeating the same
words, maybe talking more slowly or perhaps by filling in a few details.
But the students can follow the steps but they still don’t understand the
mathematical ideas. This pedagogical impasse is created by the
assumption that teaching mathematics is communicating formal structure
or proofs. However, often understanding the mathematical ideas requires
going behind the formal structure of proofs. Teaching is not merely
proving theorems but communicating the mathematical ideas so that the
truth of the theorem can be not only followed, but understood or
comprehended, in a deeper, more intuitive, way.

So we have reason to be skeptical about Peirce’s pronouncement:

> *"It \[Euler’s identity\] is absolutely paradoxical; we cannot
> understand it, and we don't know what it means, but we have proved it,
> and therefore we know it must be the truth."*

Here’s how Euler, in his *Introduction in Analysis Infinitorum*, derived
his equation from the following trigonometric identity:
$$e^{ \pm i x}=\cos (x) \pm \sin (x).$$
Here if we simply substitute π for the variable $x$, we have we have:
$$e^{i \pi}=-1+0,$$
from which Euler’s identity immediately follows. This proof, while
concise, is conceptually incomplete.

Beginning the proof with a puzzling *complex* trigonometric equation
begs the conceptual question: what does exponentiation have to do with
trigonometry? After all, both the *sine* and *cosine* functions are
*periodic* and *bounded*, but the *exponential* function is
*non-periodic* and *unbounded*. How then can an exponential function
like $e^x$ which rapidly expands to positive infinity be
defined in terms of periodic trigonometric functions whose values are
confined to the interval from $1$ to $-1$?

## Expanding Exponentiation: From Powers of Numbers to Power Series

The answer to this question involves thinking of exponentiation not
merely as a *power function* that produces a number but as a *power
series.* We have already encountered infinite series when discussing
Zeno’s paradoxes. For example, Zeno’s dichotomy paradox involved the
*geometric* series
$$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{2^n}=\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{8}+\frac{1}{16}+\frac{1}{32}+\frac{1}{64}+\cdots+\frac{1}{2^n}+\cdots.$$
Figuring out the sum of such an infinite geometric series depended on
the observation that multiplying the series by the common factor of ½
results in truncating the first term:
$$\begin{aligned}
X&{}=\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{8}+\frac{1}{16}+\frac{1}{32}+\frac{1}{64}+\cdots+\frac{1}{2^n}+\cdots\\
\frac{1}{2} X&{}={}\phantom{\frac{1}{2}+{}}\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{8}+\frac{1}{16}+\frac{1}{32}+\frac{1}{64}+\cdots+\frac{1}{2^n}+\cdots.
\end{aligned}$$
So by subtracting half the series from the entire series, we simply
have:
$$X=1$$
Another way of seeing this result geometrically is the following "proof
without words":
<!-- 
TODO

<img src="./attachments/euler2/media/image1.jpeg"
style="width:2.42361in;height:2.34028in" alt="zeno-08.jpg" /> -->
$$X={\color{red}\frac{1}{2}}+{\color{blue}\frac{1}{4}}+{\color{green}\frac{1}{8}}+{\color{orange}\frac{1}{16}}+{\color{red}\frac{1}{32}}+{\color{blue}\frac{1}{64}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{2^n}+\cdots.$$
The same idea for summing an infinite geometric series works, not only
for $r=\frac{1}{2}$, but for any $r$ whose absolute value is $<1$. In general,
the infinite sum exists when $\lvert r\rvert<1$,
$$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{a}{r^n}=a+\frac{a}{r}+\frac{a}{r^2}+\frac{a}{r^3}+\frac{a}{r^4}+\frac{a}{r^5}+\ldots+\frac{a}{2^n}+\cdots=\frac{a}{1-r}.$$

Now the idea of *power series* comes about by replacing *numbers* with
a variable resulting in the sum of an infinite series of *power
functions*. Generally, a power series is of the form
$$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n z^n=a_0+a_1 z+a_2 z^2+a_3 z^3+\cdots+a_n z^n+\cdots,$$
where $a_0,a_1,\dots,a_n,\dots$ is some sequence of numbers.
The reason for representing a function as a
power series is that it is easy to compute the derivative of such a
series term by term using the fact that the derivative of
$$f(x)=a_n x^n$$
is
$$f^{\prime}(x)=(n-1) a_n x^{n-1}.$$

Now remember that the defining characteristic of the exponential
function is that the derivative of $e^x$ is just
$e^x$. How can we create a power series in which the
derivative of the series, taken term by term, results in the very same
series?

$$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^n}{n !}=1+x+\frac{x^2}{2 !}+\frac{x^3}{3 !}+\frac{x^4}{4 !}+\frac{x^5}{5 !}+\cdots+\frac{x^n}{n !}+\cdots$$

So taking the term-wise derivative is the infinite series itself!
Now this is precisely the defining feature of the exponential function:
$$e^x=1+x+\frac{x^2}{2 !}+\frac{x^3}{3 !}+\frac{x^4}{4 !}+\frac{x^5}{5 !}+\cdots+\frac{x^n}{n !}+\cdots;$$
this power series can be used to estimate the value of $e$.

The following spreadsheet, computing the value of $e$ for the first $12$
terms, gives an approximation accurate to the first $9$ decimal places.

Euler’s power series gives a quick and accurate estimate of the value of
*e* because the factorials in the denominator grow quickly diminishing
the contribution of the successive terms, which quickly approaches zero.
However, the value of power series does not necessarily lie in computing
approximate values.

Leibniz was proud of his discovery (1674) of the quadrature or
Leibniz--Gregory series (Gregory discovered the series in 1671):
$${\color{green}\frac{\pi}{4}=1-\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{5}-\frac{1}{7}+\frac{1}{9}-\frac{1}{11}+\cdots}$$
In an infinitely-approximating way, Leibniz’s series provides a
"solution" to the classic geometrical problem of squaring the circle.
But Leibniz’s series is practically useless in calculating the digits of
π. Not only does it converge extremely slowly but it does not yield
digits that are *stable*. For example, if you compute the first five
terms of the series then the partial sum is $0.8349206$, which is within
$\frac{1}{11}$ of the true value of $\frac{\pi}{4}$, but not a single digit of the partial sum
is correct!

Similarly, the mathematical value of the exponential power series lies
not so much as its usefulness in *calculating* the digits of $e$, but in
itself providing *conceptual* insight into how to generalize exponentiation
to unify two formerly distinct mathematical domains. The catalyst for
the intuitive leap is the curious way in which the power series for the
trigonometric functions of sine and cosine appear to be "contained" in
the exponential power series:
$$e^x={\color{red}1}+{\color{green}x}+{\color{red}\frac{x^2}{2 !}}+{\color{green}\frac{x^3}{3 !}}+{\color{red}\frac{x^4}{4 !}}+{\color{green}\frac{x^5}{5 !}}+{\color{red}\frac{x^6}{6 !}}+\cdots+\frac{x^n}{n !}+\cdots,$$
$${\color{green}\sin (x)=x-\frac{x^3}{3 !}+\frac{x^5}{5 !}-\frac{x^7}{7 !}+\frac{x^9}{9 !}-\frac{x^{11}}{11 !}+\cdots},$$
$${\color{red}\cos (x)=1-\frac{x^2}{2 !}+\frac{x^4}{4 !}-\frac{x^6}{6 !}+\frac{x^8}{8 !}-\frac{x^{10}}{10 !}+\cdots}.$$

The terms of the *sine* power series are the *odd* powers and the terms
of the *cosine* power series are the even powers. The question is how
to account for the alternation of $+$ and $-$ signs. And to repeat, the
*sine* and *cosine* functions are *periodic* and *bounded*, but the
*exponential* function is *non-periodic* and *unbounded*. How then can
an exponential function like $e^x$ which rapidly expands to
positive infinity be defined in terms of periodic trigonometric
functions whose values are confined to the interval from $1$ to $-1$?

To solve this part of the puzzle we need to explore the undue prejudice
directed against imaginary numbers.
