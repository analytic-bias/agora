# 5.1. The Elegance of Euler’s Identity

In 1749 Euler published in his *Introductio in Analysis Infinitorum* an
equation considered by many to be the most beautiful in all of
mathematics:

*e*<sup>*i**π*</sup>+ 1 = 0.

Euler’s equation is succinct in its elegance and depth. Euler’s identity
uses the three basic arithmetic operations of addition, multiplication,
and exponentiation to conceptually link three number systems connecting
five of the most fundamental constants of mathematics.

π The two ubiquitous *transcendental numbers* π and *e,*

*e*

*i* The square root of –1, the basis of the *imaginary or complex
numbers*.

Carl Friedrich Gauss, the “Prince of Mathematicians,” reported said that
anyone to whom Euler’s identity was not immediately apparent would never
become a first-class mathematician. Whether or not one wishes to become
a first-class mathematician, our goal is to demystify Euler’s equation
and to explain the mathematical ideas in Euler’s beautiful equation in a
way accessible to those with a minimal mathematical education. The
remarkable beauty of Euler’s derivation of his equation derives not only
from its deep *connections* of five fundamental mathematical constants,
but also in its masterful illustration of the *cognitive* strategies
mathematicians deploy they are creating new mathematical discoveries.
This last phrase “creating… mathematical discoveries” may seem
paradoxical: do mathematicians discover mathematical truths or
creatively construct them?

As we shall see in this case study, the answer is ‘yes’. Mathematical
thinking includes:

-   creating new number systems by constructing solutions to equations;

-   studying geometric representations as new mathematical objects;

-   turning anomalous singularities into higher-level symmetries;

-   generalizing equations by expanding the domain of mathematical
    objects;

-   unifying conceptual domains by making bold conjectural
    identifications.

—<span class="smallcaps">Mark Kac</span> (1914-1984) (quoted in Nahim,
p. 9)

In this quotation, Mark Kac distinguishes ordinary geniuses from
mathematical magicians. Euler’s equation, it must be admitted, appears
to be the work of a magician. Let’s enumerate some of the mysteries of
Euler’s equation, which can be expressed:

*e*<sup>*i**π*</sup> = − 1 .

 

First, there is the mystery of *negative numbers* whose existence was
considered dubious by mathematicians even up to the 18<sup>th</sup>
century. One intuitive way to motivate negative numbers is to use the
analogy with debt. This analogy makes sense with addition of credits and
debits, but breaks down when one tries to continue the analogy and work
out what the product of two debts might be.[1] Euler himself in his
*Algebra* (1770), used the analogy of debt, but did not fall into the
usually mistake of trying to explain that the product of two debts must
be positive. Instead, Euler gave a negative “explanation” of why “minus
times minus is plus” by considering logically exhaustive cases: *– a × –
b* cannot be *– ab* since this what is given by *– a × b* and the change
in sign of *b* should give a change in sign of the answer. Therefore,
Euler argued, *– a × – b* must *ab.* Notice that Euler’s argument
doesn’t give an *explanation* of why a negative times a negative is a
positive, but instead gives a *systematic* argument for why the product
of two negative can’t be assigned a negative. But negativity isn’t all
that’s mystifying about Euler’s formula.

Secondly, there is the mystery of the *exponential function*:

*e*<sup>*i**π*</sup> = − 1 .

As our math teacher taught us exponentiation, the meaning of
2<sup>3</sup> is that you take the *base* 2 and multiply itself the
number of times indicated the *exponent* 3. In other words,

2<sup>3</sup> = 2 × 2 × 2 = 8 .

In Euler’s formula instead of integers like 2 and 3, we have the
*transcendental* *real* numbers *e* and *π* and the *imaginary* number
*i*. The real numbers π and *e* are not only *irrational* numbers—that
is, they are *not* expressible as the *ratio* of integers (e.g.,
$\sqrt{2}$ is irrational and so has a non-repeating decimal
representation), but they are also *non-algebraic*—that is, they are not
the solutions or roots of any polynomial with integer coefficients. The
transcendental number π is the ratio of the circumference to the
diameter of a circle and is non-repeating decimal which begins with
3.1415926… (to remember the digits of π you can count the letters of the
words in the sentence *“may I have a large container of coffee”.* The
transcendental number *e* is defined as the base of an exponential
function such that its rate of change, or derivative, is equal to itself
(to remember the digits of e you can count the letters in the words in
the sentence “*to express e remember to remember a sentence to remember
this”*). We we round these transcendental numbers doesn to the near
integer, then *e*<sup>*π*</sup> is similar to the number 2<sup>3</sup>.

Thirdly, there is the mystery of the *imaginary component* in the
exponent of the exponential function.

*e*<sup>*i**π*</sup> = − 1 .

If negative numbers and the fact that –1 × –1 = +1 can be mystifying,
then the real possibility of the imaginary number $i = \\\sqrt{- 1}$ is
even more mystifying. Since the square of any real number—negative or
positive—must be positive, no real number can be the square root of a
negative number. Euler himself in his *Algebra* (1770) wrote:

> *“All such expressions as* $\sqrt{- 1\\},\\\sqrt{- 2\\}$*, etc., are
> consequently impossible or imaginary numbers, since they represent
> roots of negative quantities, and of such numbers we may truly assert
> that they are neither nothing, nor greater than nothing, nor less than
> nothing, which necessarily constitutes them imaginary or impossible.”*

Fourthly, there is the question of the nature of the identity in Euler’s
equation:

*e*<sup>*i**π*</sup>+ 1 = 0

Identities, equations, equivalences are used in various ways in
mathematics. In the equation

*x* + 7 = 12 ,

the identity sign is used to equate two ways of expressing the name
number and the variable *x* stands for an specific unknown number. In
the following equation

(*x* + *y*) × (*x* – *y*) = *x*<sup>2</sup> – *y*<sup>2</sup>

the identity is used to express a law known as the *difference of two
squares* and the variables are used to stand generality for any
integers.

Another mathematical use of the identity sign in mathematics is for
stating *equivalence relations*. When the integers are logically
constructed from the natural numbers, an equivalence relation = is
defined on ordered pairs of natural numbers using the previously defined
realtion of addition + on natural numbers:

(*a* – *b*) = (*c* – *d*)

if and only if

*a* + *d* = *b* + *c* .

The former relation is proven to be an *equivalence relation* by showing
that the relation is reflexive, symmetric and transitive.

Still another use of the identity sign is to define the operations of
addition + and multiplication × on the equivalence classes of ordered
pairs of natural numbers and the previous relations of addition + and
multiplication × on natural numbers.

   (*a*, *b*)+ (*c*, *d*) = (*a* + *c*, *b* + *d*)

(*a*, *b*) × (*c*, *d*) = ((*a* × *c*) + (*b* × *d*),  (*a* × *d*) + (**b** × **c**))

Finally, identities can be used to make *bold conjectures*—a proposed
identification which organizes ideas from previously separate cognitive
domains into a new paradigm. Perhaps the most famous identity of this
sort is Einstein’s equation proposing the mass-energy equivalence in his
famous 1905 paper, *“Does the inertia of a body depend on its
energy-content?”*

*E* = *m**c*<sup>2</sup> .

In this equivalence, the total internal energy *E* of a body at rest is
equal to the product of its rest mass *m* and a suitable conversion
factor, here expressed in terms of the square of the speed of light, to
transform units of mass to units of energy. Einstein was not the first
to propose the mass-energy equivalence, but he rightly is given the
credit for proposing that this identity in the contexts of a new
paradigm created by the theory of relativity.

Stringing these mysteries together, we have in Euler’s equation the
identification of a transcendental number raised to an exponent which is
the product of a transcendental number and an imaginary number with the
negative number − 1. It is easy to understand why the Nobel physicist
Richard P. Feynman called Euler’s formula “one of the most remarkable
formulas in mathematics.” Feynman was known for figuring things out for
himself rather than taking things on authority and his youthful
notebooks have the workings out of Euler’s equation. In Feynman’s
spirit, let’s take a mathematical journey in which we figure out the
meaning of Euler’s remarkable identity for ourselves—not being content
with mere proofs but instead taking the time to demystify the elements
of Euler’s beautiful equation.

In demystifying Euler’s equation, our goal is not to not dispel its
beauty, but perhaps by taking the time to explain how mathematicians
create, we will finally come to appreciate—in a mathematically precise
rather than a mystically vague way—the beauty of Euler’s equation.

# 5.3. A Concise, but Conceptually Incomplete, Proof

> *“It \[Euler’s identity\] is absolutely paradoxical; we cannot
> understand it, and we don't know what it means, but we have proved it,
> and therefore we know it must be the truth."*
>
> —<span class="smallcaps">Benjamin Peirce (1809-1880)</span>

The 19<sup>th</sup> century Harvard mathematician Benjamin
Peirce--father of logician and pragmatist philosopher C. S. Peirce
(1839-1914)—is reported to have made the above remark after proving
Euler’s identity. The quotation underscores a fact overlooked on a
pedagogy of mathematics that is based on reproducing proofs: proofs by
themselves need not yield any deep conceptual understanding of the
mathematics underlying the proof.

In his above mentioned *Introductio in Analysis Infinitorum* Euler
derived his equation from the following trigonometric equation:

*e*<sup>±*i**x*</sup> = cos (*x*) ± *i* sin (*x*) .

Here we simply substitute π for the variable *x*. Since
*cos*(π) = −1 and *sin*(π) = 0, we have

*e<sup>i</sup>*<sup>π</sup> = − 1 + 0 

from which we can immediately deduce Euler’s equation:
*e*<sup>π*ι*</sup> + 1 = 0 .

The proof given here, while concise, is not conceptually illuminating.
Beginning the proof with a puzzling complex trigonometric equation as
the first premise begs the conceptual question of what exponentiation
has to do with trigonometry. How can an exponential function like
*e<sup>x</sup>* which rapidly expands to positive infinity be defined in
terms of periodic trigonometric functions whose values are confined to
interval from 1 to −<!-- -->1?

# 5.4. Making Connections/Creating Mathematics

## Connection 1. From Negativity to Complexity

*e*<sup>*π**i*</sup>=  − 1

How does negativity, in particular −1, come about conceptually in
mathematics? The negative integers are added to (“logically constructed
from” ) the natural numbers when we want to have solutions to equations
such as

*x* + 1 = 0 .

No natural number can be a solution to this equation. (Proof: the left
hand side of the equation is the successor of *x*, and according to
Peano’s third postulate, zero is not equal to the successor of any
natural number.) By embedding the natural numbers in the richer context
of integers with positive and negative numbers, there is a solution to
every arithmetic equation involving subtraction, the inverse operation
of addition.

When multiplication by −<!-- -->1 is represented geometrically in terms
of the number line, the negative sign not only creates new *numbers*,
but also adds the concept of *direction* on the number line. A minus
sign indicates a change of direction—a *rotation* of 180 degrees—on the
number line. Understood in these terms, it is perfectly understandable
that a change of direction followed by another change of direction
cancel each other out:

−1 ×  − 1 = 1  .

−<!-- -->1 l

The puzzle about justifying the law that a “negative times a negative is
a positive” by finding an interpretation for multiplying debts is based
on an inadequate conception of a negative number. A better way to think
about multiplying by – 1 is as a sign that indicates changing directions
on the number line. To add – 5 and – 6 is to continue on the number line
from the origin in the negative direction for a total of 11 units, and
to multiply – 5 by 6 to go 5 × 6 = 30 units in the negative direction.
However, to multiply – 5 by – 6 is to multiply 5 by 6 changing
directions twice and ending up on the positive direction.

The construction of imaginary numbers from real numbers can be done in a
way that is completely analogous to the construction of negative numbers
from natural numbers.

Negative Numbers: A Tale of Two Minuses

*Minus times minus is plus.*

*The reason for this we need not discuss.*

— W. H. Auden

There was skepticism about the negative numbers up until the
18<sup>th</sup> century. Negative numbers were introduced to have
solutions to equations such as

*x* + 1 = 0  .

No natural number can be a solution to this equation. According to one
of Peano’s postulates, 0 is not the successor of any natural number. We
can expand the natural numbers by adding the negative integers. Negative
numbers can, for example, be introduced to make it easy to calculate
debts. If you owe 5 dollars to Abe and 10 dollars to Beatrice, but you
only have 2 dollars, then you owe a total of 13 dollars—you have, so to
speak, −13 dollars. If you owe five dollars five times over, then your
total debt is 5 ×  − 5 = −25 .

However, does it make sense to ask how much you own if you owe 5 dollars
a *negative* 5 times over?

Negative numbers can be modeled by a pair of natural numbers that obey
the following laws for addition and multiplication:

(*a*, *b*)+ (*c*, *d*) = (*a* + *c*, *b* + *d*)

(*a*, *b*) × (*c*, *d*) = (*a**c* + *b**d*, *a**d* + *b**c*) .

Even the great mathematician Euler commented (incorrectly) upon the
perplexing law, which we now take for granted:

−1 ×  − 1 = 1  .

Prove the above law that a minus times a minus is plus follows from the
*distributive law*

*a*(*b* + *c*)= *a**b* + *a**c*  ,

together with the following facts:

1 + (−1)= 0 ; (−1) × 0 = 0 ; (−1) × 0 = 0

Extending the natural number line to the left, one generates the
negative integers by multiply the natural numbers by −1. Geometrically
speaking, multiplication by −1 is a rotation of 180 degrees. The
initially puzzling fact that −1 ×  − 1 = 1 corresponds to the geometric
fact that two 180 degree rotations brings you back to the beginning. The
integers are constructed as equivalence classes of ordered pairs of
natural numbers and the negative integers are geometrically generated by
multiplication by −1.  
Complex Numbers: An Imaginary Journey

*Imaginary i times i is minus one.*

*Let me tell you why it can be done!*

There has also been widespread skepticism about imaginary numbers even
up to the present day. Imaginary numbers were introduced to have
solutions to equations such as

*x*<sup>2</sup>+ 1  = 0  .

No real number r can be a solution to this equation. A real number is
either positive or negative; but a positive times a positive is a
positive, and a negative times a negative is also a positive and so
*r*  × *r* ≠ − 1. Negative numbers can be seen as involving a rotation
of 180 degrees. Complex numbers can be introduced to make it easier to
calculate rotations without tedious trigonometry.

What does *i*  × *i* = − 1 mean in terms of rotation?

Multiplying by –1 is a rotation of 180 degrees. Geometrically speaking,
multiplication by *i* is a counter-clockwise rotation of 90 degrees or
π/2 radians. Two successive rotations *i*  × *i* is equal to –1.

Complex numbers can be modeled by a pair of real numbers that obey the
following laws for addition and multiplication:

(*a*, *b*)+ (*c*, *d*) = (*a* + *c*, *b* + *d*)

(*a*, *b*) × (*c*, *d*) = (*a**c***−***b**d*, *a**d* + *b**c*) .

Euler wrote “All such expressions $\sqrt{- 1}$, $\sqrt{- 2}$, etc. are
consequently impossible or imaginary numbers….” (*Algebra*, 1770). We
have the following cycle of facts:

*i*<sup>1</sup>= *i* ; *i*<sup>2</sup>=  − 1; *i*<sup>3</sup>=  − *i* ;
*i*<sup>4</sup>= 1 .

If *c* = *a* + i*b*, then the *modulus* of *c* is
$\sqrt{a^{2\\} + \\b^{2}}.$ By the Pythagorean theorem. this is the
distance from the origin to the point (*a, b*). The *argument* of a
complex number *c* = *a* + i*b* is the *angle* formed by the positive
real *x*-axis and the line from (0, 0) to (*a, b*).

Every complex number can be represented by a modulus and an argument
using polar coordinates. Multiplication of complex numbers in this form

*c* = *r*\[cos(θ) + *i*sin(θ)\]

*d* = *s*\[cos(ρ) + *i*sin(ρ)\]

amounts to this: (1) the *modulus* of the product is the *product* of
the moduli; and (2) the *argument* of the product is the *sum* of the
*arguments, i.e,*

*c*  × *d* = *r* × *s*\[cos (*θ* + *ρ*)+ *i*sin (*θ* + *ρ*)\] .

Multiplication by a unit length is equivalent to pure rotation.

## Connection 2. From **−****1** in Cartesian Coordinates to $\sqrt{\mathbf{- 1\\}}$ in Polar Coordinates

> *“All such expressions as* $\sqrt{- 1\\},\\\sqrt{- 2\\}$*, etc., are
> consequently impossible or imaginary numbers, since they represent
> roots of negative quantities, and of such numbers we may truly assert
> that they are neither nothing, nor greater than nothing, nor less than
> nothing, which necessarily constitutes them imaginary or impossible.”*

-   Euler, *Algebra* (1770)

*x*<sup>2</sup>+ 1  = 0  .

No real number r can be a solution to this equation. A real number is
either positive or negative; but a positive times a positive is a
positive, and a negative times a negative is also a positive and so
*r*  × *r* ≠ − 1. Negative numbers can be seen as involving a rotation
of 180 degrees. Complex numbers can be introduced to make it easier to
calculate rotations without tedious trigonometry.

What does *i*  × *i* = − 1 mean in terms of rotation?

Multiplying by –1 is a rotation of 180 degrees. Geometrically speaking,
multiplication by *i* is a counter-clockwise rotation of 90 degrees or
π/2 radians. Two successive rotations *i*  × *i* is equal to –1.

Complex numbers can be modeled by a pair of real numbers that obey the
following laws for addition and multiplication:

(*a*, *b*)+ (*c*, *d*) = (*a* + *c*, *b* + *d*)

(*a*, *b*) × (*c*, *d*) = (*a**c***−***b**d*, *a**d* + *b**c*) .

Adding complex numbers to the real numbers, leads to the elegant result
that every polynomial of degree *n* will have *n* solutions or roots.
For example, the above polynomial of degree 2 has 2 solutions, namely,
*i* and *–i*.

By convention a complex number is expressed as *a* + *ib*, where *a* is
the real component and *b* the imaginary component of the complex
number. *Notice that the plus sign doesn’t really signify addition.* The
plus sign is merely used to separate the real and imaginary components,
and so we can less confusingly used an ordered pair of real numbers to
represent a complex number.

Given the ordered pair (*a, b*) it is natural to represent the complex
number on the Cartesian coordinate plane. The *x*-axis is the real
component and the *y*-axis is the imaginary component of the complex
number.

As we have seen a rotation of 180 degrees or π radians is equivalent to
multiplying by −1. To geometrically represent *i*, we need a
transformation which when applied to itself result in a multiplication
by −1 or a rotation of π radians. A rotation of 90 degrees or π/2
radians is a natural way to represent this transformation. The rotations
of π result in −1 and + 1 along the horizontal *x*-axis, and rotations
of π/2 result in the cycle of values *i*, −1, −*i*, 1 with *i* and –*i*
along the vertical *y*-axis at the values of θ equal to π/2 and 3π/2,
respectively. This is the third clue linking the representation of the
imaginary number *i* in terms of rotation in the geometric
representation of complex numbers.

*i*

*–*1 l

*–i*

To summarize our steps so far, we have a conceptual connection between
−1 as multiplication and rotation of 180 degrees or π radians, and the
trigonometric functions cos(θ) and sin(θ) within the unit circle. To
geometrically represent the imaginary unit *i* such that *i* x *i* = −1,
we need a rotation which when applied twice is equal to a rotation of
180 degrees or π radians. This requirement is satisfied by a rotation of
90 degrees or π/2 radians. This rotation results in the cycle of
repeating values *i<sup>0</sup>* = 1, *i<sup>1</sup>* = *i*,
*i<sup>2</sup>=* −1, *i<sup>3</sup>=* −*i*, *i<sup>4</sup>=* 1,
*i<sup>5</sup>* = *i*, *i<sup>6</sup>=* −1, *i<sup>7</sup>=* −*i*,
*i<sup>8</sup>=* 1, … The next conceptual link to be forged is with the
transcendental number *e* and the exponential function with base *e*.

To obtain the *Cartesian coordinate plane* to represent ordered pairs
(*x, y*) we place another copy of the number line for the integers (the
*y*-axis), perpendicular or at 90 degrees to the original number line
(the *x*-axis). In this way the ordered pairs in the equivalence classes
constructing the integers can be modeled as ordered pairs on the lines
parallel to the line *x* = *y.*

The same Cartesian coordinate plane can be used to represent rational
numbers. When *x* and *y* take on integer values with *y* ≠ 0, the line
determined by the origin and the point (*x, y*) passes through all the
ordered pairs equal to the rational number *x/y.* All such lines whose
rays in the first quadrant form an angle with the *x*-axis less than 45
degrees represent all the rational larger than 1 and the lines whose
rays in the first quadrant lie between 45 degrees and 90 degrees
represent the rational numbers less than 1.

*e*<sup>*π**i*</sup>=  − 1

Next we need to find the conceptual link is between −1 and the imaginary
number $i = \sqrt{- 1}$

The problem with thinking of the imaginary unit $i = \sqrt{- 1}$ as a
quantity is that it can’t be any real number. As we have seen it, like
the number −<!-- -->1, is a rotation.

Cartesian coordinate plane for the real numbers when *x* and *y* can
take on any real numbered values such as the values for the
trigonometric functions sine and cosine. However, since the values of
these trigonometric functions are proportional for all similar
triangles, it is convenient to represent these values within a circle of
radius 1.

Therefore, rather than using a pair of *Cartesian coordinates* to
specify a point (*x*, *y*), it is more natural to use *polar
coordinates* specified by a central angle θ and a radius *r* =
$\sqrt{x^{2} + \\y^{2}}.\\$ When confining our attention to the unit
circle, the trigonometric functions are defined in terms of θ. The
Pythagorean theorem, for example, can be expressed by the trigonometric
equation:

1 = cos<sup>2</sup>(θ) + sin<sup>2</sup>(θ) .

The values of cos(θ) are read on the *x*-axis and the values of sin(θ)
are read on the *y*-axis for a right triangle whose right angle is
formed perpendicular to the *x*-axis and whose hypotenuse is a radius
from the origin to the unit circle.

sin(θ)

θ

−1 0 cos(θ) 1

Using polar coordinates, a rotation of 180 degrees can be expressed as a
rotation of π radians, and rotation of 2π brings us back to the starting
point. Notice that at the value of θ = π, *cos*(θ) = −1 and *sin*(θ) =
0. This is the second clue linking −1, or a rotation of π radians, to
the trigonometric functions *cos*(θ) and *sin*(θ) for the value θ = π.

## Connection 3. From the Derivative to Infinite Series

Consider Zeno’s arrow paradox. If you look at the arrow in flight at an
instant—or indivisible moment of time—it is indistinguishable from the
arrow at rest. However, the flight of the arrow is just the infinite
collection of moments of time. How can an infinite collection of
motionless arrows become the arrow in motion? One way to begin to
unravel Zeno’s paradox is to develop the concept of *instantaneous
velocity.* In order to distinguish the arrow in motion from the arrow at
rest, we need to look at what is happening in the interval of time
surrounding that instant of time. The notion of a non-zero
*instantaneous velocity* is what is needed to solve Zeno’s paradox of
the arrow. This concept is captured by the mathematical concept of the
derivative.

The derivative is one of the two fundamental ideas of calculus. The
derivative is a mathematical model of change. Given a real-valued
function *f*(*x*), the derivative of *f* is the function *f’*(*x*) which
is the rate of change of *f*.

Conceptually, the derivative of a function is the rate of change of that
function at a point in time. The *derivative of a function f*(*x*) is
the limit of the function in the interval of *dx* around *x* as *dx*
goes to zero:

$$\lim\_{dx \rightarrow 0}\left( \frac{f(x + dx) - f(x)}{dx} \right)^{}$$

Geometrically, the derivative of a function *f*(*x*) is the slope of the
tangent line to its graph. In graphical terms, if we have the graph of

*y* = *f*(*x*) ,

then *f*’(*x*) is the slope of the line which is tangent to the graph of
*f*(*x*) at the point *x* is the derivative.[2] We can write this using
Leibniz’s notation:

$\frac{dx}{dy}$ = *f’*(*x*) .

In our example, the derivative of *f*(*x*) = *x<sup>2</sup>* is computed
as follows:

$$\lim\_{dx \rightarrow 0}{\left( \frac{{(x + dx)}^{2} - x^{2}}{dx} \right) = \frac{x^{2} + \\2xdx - x^{2}}{dx} = 2xdx}^{}$$

So the derivative, or rate of change, of the function *f*(*x*) =
*x<sup>2</sup>* is the function *f*(*x*) = 2*x.*

## Connection 4. The Derivative to the Natural Exponential Function

*e*<sup>*π**i*</sup>=  − 1

How can *e* both a transcendental number calculated to be approximately
2.7182818284… and the base for an exponential function *e<sup>x</sup>*
whose rate of change is equal to itself?

Recall the fundamental idea of exponentiation and its relationship to
multiplication and addition. We can compute the product of two numbers
with the same base, say 2<sup>3</sup> and 2<sup>7</sup>, by simply
adding their exponents 2<sup>3</sup> x 2<sup>7</sup> = 2<sup>3+7</sup> .
A standard table of logarithms with a base of 10 expresses numbers as
exponents, and so multiplying two numbers is equivalent to adding their
exponents and then using the table of logarithms backwards to compute
their product. This is how a slide rule works: it has two logarithmic
scales to compute products by adding logarithms. Just as 10 is not the
most mathematically natural base for the number system, logarithms based
on powers of 10 is not the most natural base for logarithms. In general,
an *exponential function* with base *a* is a function of the form *y* =
*a<sup>x</sup>*, where *a* &gt; 1.

The defining property of the exponential function *e<sup>x</sup>* is
that its rate of change is equal to itself. You may remember memorizing
in calculus classes that the derivative of *e<sup>x\ </sup>*is
*e<sup>x</sup>*. When the value of *x* = 1, the value of the function
*e<sup>x</sup>* is simply the value of *e*. According to a mathematical
characterization: *e<sup>x</sup>* is an exponential function whose
*derivative* is equal to itself.

Many processes in the natural and financial worlds have this property.
Euler’s antediluvian example in his *Introduction to the Analysis of the
Infinite* (1784, published 1988, with an English translation by John
Blanton, Springer-Verlag, New York, p. 92) is population growth:

> “Since after the Flood all men descended from a population of six, if
> we suppose that the population after two hundred years was 1,000,000,
> we would like to find the annual rate of growth.”

A more worldly example, also studied by Euler, is the growth rate of
*compounded interest*. In 1683 Jacob Bernoulli (1654-1705) arrived at
the number *e* by modeling compounded interest. If a principal amount of
earns interest at an annual rate of *x* compounded monthly, then the
interest earned each month is *x*/12 times the current value, so each
month the total value is multiplied by (1 + *x*/12) and the value at the
end of the year is (1 + *x*/12)<sup>12</sup>. If interest is compounded
daily, we have (1 + *x*/365)<sup>365</sup>. If the time intervals per
year increase, the limit of this function is the exponential function.
This is Euler’s formula for *e<sup>x</sup>* as continuous interest:

$$e^{x} = \\\lim\_{x \rightarrow \infty}\left( 1 + \frac{1}{x} \right)^{x}$$

It is possible to derive Euler’s definition of the exponential function
using the concept of the *derivative*.[3]

Geometrically, the derivative of a function *f*(*x*) is the slope of the
tangent line to its graph computed by taking the limit as the interval
around the *x* value is smaller and smaller:

$$\lim\_{dx \rightarrow 0}\left( \frac{f(x + dx) - f(x)}{dx} \right)^{}$$

Substituting for the function *f(x)* an exponential function with base
*b*, we obtain

$$\lim\_{dx \rightarrow 0}\left( \frac{b^{x + dx} - b^{x}}{dx} \right)^{}$$

Exponential was introduced to make multiplication easier. The basic idea
is that multiplication of numbers expressed as powers with the same base
is equivalent to addition of exponents. Using the idea that
exponentiation turns multiplication into addition, we have the crucial
step:

$$\lim\_{dx \rightarrow 0}\left( \frac{b^{x}b^{dx} - b^{x}}{dx} \right)^{}$$

Now factoring out the *b<sup>x</sup>*, we obtain:

$$\lim\_{dx \rightarrow 0}\left( \frac{b^{x}{(b}^{dx} - {1)}^{}}{dx} \right)^{}$$

Now to solve for *e*, the base of the exponential function whose rate of
change, *derivative*, is equal to itself, we set the limit equal to *b*.

$$\lim\_{dx \rightarrow 0}{\left( \frac{b^{x}{(b}^{dx} - {1)}^{}}{dx} \right) = b}^{}$$

The value when *x* = 1 of the function *b<sup>x</sup>*, by convention,
is the constant base *b*, which can be brought out the limit expression.

$${b\\\lim\_{dx \rightarrow 0}}\left( \frac{b^{dx} - 1^{}}{dx} \right)^{} = b$$

Cancelling out common factor of *b* from both side and multiplying both
sides of the equation by *dx,* we have

>  lim<sub>*d**x* → 0</sub>(*b*<sup>*d**x*</sup> − 1)= *d**x*

Dropping the limit notation temporarily, we can solve for
*b<sup>dx</sup>*:

*b* *<sup>dx</sup>* = 1 + *dx*

Now *dx* going to zero is equivalent to 1/*x* going to zero as *x* goes
to infinity. Expressed in this form, we can element exponent by raising
both sides to the power *n.*

$$b\underset{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\x \rightarrow \infty}{= \\lim}{(1 + \frac{1}{x})}^{x}$$

But the exponential function whose base *b* is such that the function
grows proportional to itself is just the definition of *e<sup>x</sup>*
and so we obtain Euler’s famous formula noted above:

$${e^{x}\underset{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\x \rightarrow \infty}{= \\lim}}{(1 + \frac{1}{x})}^{x}$$

## Connection 5. From Infinite Series to Power Series

Zeno’s paradoxes involved an infinite series such that each term is the
series was a number. For example, the dichotomy involved the *geometric*
series

$$\sum\_{n = 0}^{\infty}{\frac{1}{2^{n\\}} = 1 + \\\frac{1}{2}} + \\\frac{1}{4} + \\\frac{1}{8} + \\\frac{1}{16} + \\\frac{1}{32} + \ldots + \\\frac{1}{2^{n}} + \\\ldots$$

The infinite sum is defined as the limit of the finite sums
S<sub>n</sub> of the first *n* terms. So consider

$$S\_{n} = 1 + \\\frac{1}{2} + \\\frac{1}{4} + \\\frac{1}{8} + \\\frac{1}{16} + \\\ldots\\ + \\\frac{1}{2^{n}}$$

Multiplying both sides by a factor of 1/2 we obtain a series:

$$\frac{1}{2}S\_{n} = \\\frac{1}{2} + \\\frac{1}{4} + \\\frac{1}{8} + \\\frac{1}{16} + \\\ldots\\ + \\\frac{1}{2^{n + 1}}$$

Subtracting the latter from the former, we have:

$$S\_{n} - \\\frac{1}{2}S\_{n} = \\1 - \\\frac{1}{2^{n - 1}}$$

and so

$${\left( 1 - \\\frac{1}{2} \right)(S}\_{n} - \\\frac{1}{2}S\_{n}) = \\1 - \\\frac{1}{2^{n - 1}}$$

$$S\_{n} = \\\frac{1 - \\\frac{1}{2^{n + 1}}}{1 - \frac{1}{2}}$$

So the limit as *n* goes to infinity is:

$${\lim\_{n\\ \rightarrow \infty}S}\_{n} = \\\frac{1 - \\\frac{1}{2^{n + 1}}}{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = \\\frac{1}{1 - \\\frac{1}{2}}$$

<img src="./attachments/euler/media/image1.jpeg"
style="width:6.50417in;height:3.41667in" alt="zeno-08.jpg" />

The same proof for summing a geometric series works, not only for *r* =
½, but for any *r* whose absolute value is &lt; 1. The infinite sum,
this particular case, turned out to be 2. In general, the infinite sum
exists when |*r*| &lt; 1,

$$\sum\_{n = 0}^{\infty}{\frac{a}{r^{n\\}} = a + \\\frac{a}{r}} + \\\frac{a}{r^{2}} + \\\frac{a}{r^{3}} + \\\frac{a}{r^{4}} + \\\frac{a}{r^{5}} + \ldots + \\\frac{a}{r^{n}} + \\\ldots = \\\frac{a}{1 - r}$$

What happens at a = 1 and r = 1? The *harmonic series* is the infinite
sum of the reciprocal of all the natural numbers:

1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 + 1/6 + 1/7 + 1/8 +…. + 1/*n* + ….

The proof of that the harmonic series diverges is to compare the series
in blocks of powers of 2 to the clearly divergent series 1 + ½ + ½ + ½ +
….:

1 + <span class="mark">1/2</span> + (<span class="mark">1/3 +
1/4</span>) + (<span class="mark">1/5 + 1/6 + 1/7 + 1/8</span>) +
(<span class="mark">1/9 + 1/10 + 1/11 + 1/12 + 1/13 + 1/14 + 1/15 +
1/16</span>) +….

1 + <span class="mark">1/2</span> + (<span class="mark">1/4 +
1/4</span>) + (<span class="mark">1/8 + 1/8 + 1/8 + 1/8</span>) +
(<span class="mark">1/16 + 1/16 + 1/16 + 1/16 + 1/16 + 1/16 + 1/16 +
1/16</span>) + …

Each term in the harmonic series is greater than or equal to the
corresponding term in the new series which diverges to infinity.

Now the idea of a *power series* comes about by replacing numbers with a
variable resulting in the sum of an infinite series of functions.
Generally, a power series is of the form

$$\sum\_{n = 0}^{\infty}{a\_{n}z^{n} = a\_{0} + \\a\_{1}z} + \\a\_{2}z^{2} + a\_{3}z^{3} + \\a\_{4}z^{4} + \\a\_{5}z^{5} + \ldots + \\a\_{n}z^{n} + \\\ldots$$

where *a<sub>0</sub>*, *a<sub>1</sub>*, *a<sub>2</sub>*,
*a<sub>3</sub>*, *a<sub>4</sub>*, *a<sub>5</sub>*,…, *a<sub>n</sub>*,…
is some sequence of numbers. The reason for representing a function as a
power series is that it is easy to compute the derivative of such a
series term by term using the fact that the derivative of

*f*(*x*)= *a*<sub>*n*</sub>*x*<sup>*n*</sup>

is

*f*<sup>′</sup>(*x*) = (*n* − 1)*a*<sub>*n*</sub>*x*<sup>*n* − 1</sup> .

Euler also discovered a power series expansion for *e<sup>x</sup>*. In
his fast and loose manner, he took the term-wise derivative of each term
this expansion:

$$1 + x + \\\frac{x^{2}}{2!} + \\\frac{x^{3}}{3!} + \\\frac{x^{4}}{4!} + \\\frac{x^{5}}{5!} + \\\frac{x^{6}}{6!\\} + \\\frac{x^{7}}{7!} + \\\ldots + \\\frac{x^{n}}{n!} + \\\ldots$$

The derivative of 1 = 0

The derivative of *x* = 1

The derivative of $\frac{x^{2}}{2!}$ = $\frac{2x}{2} = x$

The derivative of $\frac{x^{3}}{3!}$ =
$\frac{3x}{3\\x\\2\\x\\1} = \frac{x^{2}}{2!}$

The derivative of $\frac{x^{n + 1}}{(n + 1)!}$ =
$\frac{(n{+ 1)x}^{n}}{(n + 1)n!} = \frac{x^{n}}{n!}$

Euler noticed that the result of taking the term-wise derivative is the
infinite series itself! Now this is precisely the defining feature of
the exponential function, so

$$e^{x} = \\\sum\_{n = 0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n!} = 1 + x + \\\frac{x^{2}}{2!} + \\\frac{x^{3}}{3!} + \\\frac{x^{4}}{4!} + \\\frac{x^{5}}{5!} + \\\frac{x^{6}}{6!\\} + \\\frac{x^{7}}{7!} + \\\ldots + \\\frac{x^{n}}{n!} + \\\ldots$$

This infinite series has a dual nature as either an object or an
operation, a number or an infinite sum or operation. To compute the
value of the number *e*, we can set the exponent *x* = 1, and compute
the first 12 terms.

$$e^{1} \approx \\1 + 1 + \\\frac{1}{2!} + \\\frac{1}{3!} + \\\frac{1}{4!} + \\\frac{1}{5!} + \\\frac{1}{6!\\} + \\\frac{1}{7!} + \\\ldots + \\\frac{1}{10!}$$

As you can see from the following spreadsheet, computing the value of
*e* for the first 12 sums gives an approximation accurate to the first 9
decimal places.

Euler’s formula gives a quick and accurate estimate of the value of *e*
because the factorials in the denominator grows quickly diminishing the
contribution of the successive terms which quickly approach zero.[4]

## Connection 6. Interlacing the Power Series for Sin(*x*), Cos(*x*) and *e<sup>x</sup>* 

Let’s discover the power series for

sin (*z*) = *a*<sub>0</sub>+ *a*<sub>1</sub>*z*+ *a*<sub>2</sub>*z*<sup>2</sup> + *a*<sub>3</sub>*z*<sup>3</sup>+ *a*<sub>4</sub>*z*<sup>4</sup>+ *a*<sub>5</sub>*z*<sup>5</sup> + …+ *a*<sub>*n*</sub>*z*<sup>*n*</sup>+ …

If we set *z* = 0, then all the terms except the first disappear. There
sin(0) = *a<sub>0\ </sub>* but since sin(0) = 0, *a<sub>0\ </sub>*= 0.
Recall that the derivative of *a*<sub>*n*</sub>*x*<sup>*n*</sup> is

(*n* − 1)*a*<sub>*n*</sub>*x*<sup>*n* − 1</sup>

We may compute the derivative of the power series term by term:

*s**i**n*′(*z*) = cos (*z*) = *a*<sub>1</sub>+ 2*a*<sub>2</sub>*z* + 3*a*<sub>3</sub>*z*<sup>2</sup>+ 4*a*<sub>4</sub>*z*<sup>3</sup>+ 5*a*<sub>5</sub>*z*<sup>4</sup> + …+ (*n* − 1)*a*<sub>*n*</sub>*z*<sup>*n* − 1</sup>+ …

If we set *z* = 0, then all the terms except the first disappear. There
cos(0) = 1 = *a<sub>1.</sub>*

Next take the derivative of the power series again:

cos ′(*z*) = −*s**i**n*(*z*) = 2*a*<sub>2</sub> + (3 × 2)*a*<sub>3</sub>*z*+ (4  × *a*<sub>4</sub>*z*<sup>3</sup>+ 5*a*<sub>5</sub>*z*<sup>4</sup> + …+ (*n* − 1)*a*<sub>*n*</sub>*z*<sup>*n* − 1</sup>+ …

If we set *z* = 0, then all the terms except the first disappear. There
−*s**i**n*′(0) = 0= 2*a*<sub>2</sub> so *a<sub>2</sub>* = 0.

Taking the derivative of the power series again:

−sin<sup>′</sup>(*z*)= − cos (*z*)= (3 × 2)*a*<sub>3</sub>+ (4  × 3  × 2)*a*<sub>4</sub>*z*<sup>2</sup>+ (5  × 4  × 3  × 2)*a*<sub>5</sub>*z*<sup>3</sup> + …

If we set *z* = 0, then all the terms except the first disappear and
–cos (0) = −1= 6*a*<sub>2</sub> *a**n**d* *s**o* 

$a\_{2} = - \frac{1}{6}$ .

The general pattern is that *a<sub>n</sub>* = 0 whenever *n* is even and
when *n* is odd, *a*<sub>*n*</sub>= $\pm \\\frac{1}{n!}$ with the sign
alternating. Therefore,

$$\sin{x = x - \\\frac{x^{3}}{3!} + \\\frac{x^{5}}{5!} - \\\frac{x^{7}}{7!} + \\\frac{x^{9}}{9!} - \\\frac{x^{11}}{11!} + \\\ldots}$$

*Exercise*: In a similar manner discover the power series expansion for
cos(*x*).

$$\cos{x = 1 - \\\frac{x^{2}}{2!} + \\\frac{x^{4}}{4!} - \\\frac{x^{6}}{6!} + \\\frac{x^{8}}{8!} - \\\frac{x^{10}}{10!} + \\\ldots}$$

## 

##  Connection 7. Deriving Euler’s Equation from Interlacing Power Series

Once Euler had computed the power series for *e<sup>x</sup>*, cos(*x*)
and sin(*x*), it is hard not to notice an intriguing relationship—the
power series expansions for the trigonometric functions cosine and sine
appears—except for the feature of the alternating signs—to be interwoven
in the power series expansion for exponentiation. The power series terms
for the cosine are the odd terms, and the power series terms for the
sine are the even terms, of the power series expansion for
*e<sup>x</sup>*.

$$e^{x} = \\\sum\_{n = 0}^{\infty}\frac{x^{n}}{n!} = 1 + x + \\\frac{x^{2}}{2!} + \\\frac{x^{3}}{3!} + \\\frac{x^{4}}{4!} + \\\frac{x^{5}}{5!} + \\\frac{x^{6}}{6!\\} + \\\frac{x^{7}}{7!} + \\\ldots + \\\frac{x^{n}}{n!} + \\\ldots$$

$$\sin{x = x - \\\frac{x^{3}}{3!} + \\\frac{x^{5}}{5!} - \\\frac{x^{7}}{7!} + \\\frac{x^{9}}{9!} - \\\frac{x^{11}}{11!} + \\\ldots}$$

$$\cos{x = 1 - \\\frac{x^{2}}{2!} + \\\frac{x^{4}}{4!} - \\\frac{x^{6}}{6!} + \\\frac{x^{8}}{8!} - \\\frac{x^{10}}{10!} + \\\ldots}$$

How can the exponential function, which rapidly grows to infinity,
related to the cyclical sine and cosine functions of trigonometry?
Formally, the sine function is composed of terms with the *odd* powers
of the exponent and the cosine is composed of the terms with the *even*
powers of the exponent—except for the alternating signs.

It was Euler’s great genius to see that a deep unification could be
achieved if one substitutes a complex number *ix* for the exponent *x*
in the power series for *e<sup>x</sup>*. This substitution makes sense
because the laws of addition, multiplication, and exponentiation are
naturally extended to the complex numbers. Recall the cycle of values:

*i*

*–*1 l

*–i*

$$e^{ix} = \\\sum\_{n = 0}^{\infty}\frac{{(ix)}^{n}}{n!} = 1 + ix + \\\frac{{(ix)}^{2}}{2!} + \\\frac{{(ix)}^{3}}{3!} + \\\frac{{(ix)}^{4}}{4!} + \\\frac{{(ix)}^{5}}{5!} + \\\frac{{(ix)}^{6}}{6!\\} + \\\frac{{(ix)}^{7}}{7!} + \frac{{(ix)}^{8}}{8!\\} + \ldots$$

Given the cycle of repeating values *i<sup>0</sup>* = 1, *i<sup>1</sup>*
= *i*, *i<sup>2</sup>=* −1, *i<sup>3</sup>=* −1, *i<sup>4</sup>=* 1,
*i<sup>5</sup>* = *i*, *i<sup>6</sup>=* −1, *i<sup>7</sup>=* −*i*,
*i<sup>8</sup>=* 1, we obtain alternating terms with two positives and
then two negatives:

$$e^{ix} = \\\sum\_{n = 0}^{\infty}\frac{{(ix)}^{n}}{n!} = 1 + ix - \\\frac{x^{2}}{2!} - i\frac{x^{3}}{3!} + \\\frac{x^{4}}{4!} + i\frac{x^{5}}{5!} - \frac{x^{6}}{6!\\} - i\frac{x^{7}}{7!} + \frac{x^{8}}{8!\\} + \ldots$$

Rearranging the terms, it turns out that the *odd* terms form the
alternating infinite series for the cos(x) and the *even* terms form the
alternating infinite series for the sin(x):

$$e^{ix} = \left( 1 - \\\frac{x^{2}}{2!} + \\\frac{x^{4}}{4!} - \frac{x^{6}}{6!\\} + \frac{x^{8}}{8!\\} + \ldots \right) + i\left( x - \\\frac{x^{3}}{3!} + \\\frac{x^{5}}{5!} - \frac{x^{7}}{7!\\} + \frac{x^{9}}{9!\\} + \ldots \right)$$

Substituting the trigonometric functions for their infinite expansions,
we obtain the equation:

*e*<sup>*i**x*</sup> = cos (*x*)+ *i* *s**i**n*(*x*)

The last step is to evaluate the function for the value x = π:

*e*<sup>*π**i*</sup> = cos (*π*) + *i* *s**i**n*(*π*)

But since cos(π) = —1 and sin(π) = 0, we have

*e*<sup>*π**i*</sup> = −1

and so we have derived Euler’s identity!

It remains to understand what this identity teaches us about the
mathematics of exponentiation, trigonometry, and complex numbers and the
deeper issue of unification.

-   There is only one natural way to extend the real-valued exponential
    function to the complex numbers.

-   The exponential function “contains” the sine and cosine functions
    “implicitly” but the unification comes within the context of complex
    numbers.

-   The most significant benefit of working in context of the complex
    numbers, as opposed to real numbers, is that every arithmetic
    equation (i.e., polynomial) has a solution—in fact, it systematizes
    the theory of polynomials giving the elegant result that an
    *n*-degree polynomial has *n* roots.

Given (*e*<sup>*i**x*</sup>)<sup>*n*</sup>= (*e*<sup>*i**n**x*</sup>),
we may derive *De Moive’s formula*

> (*c**o**s*(*π*) + *i* *s**i**n*(*π*))<sup>*n*</sup>= (*c**o**s*(*n**π*) + *i* *s**i**n*(*n**π*))

This explains why the real-valued polynomials have such irregular
results concerning roots—positive numbers have two square roots, whereas
negative numbers have none; all real numbers have exactly one cube root,
fifth root, and so on. The above formula tells us when we are looking
for the square roots of −1, we have that

(*c**o**s*(*θ*) + *i* *s**i**n*(*θ*))<sup>2</sup>= (*c**o**s*(2*θ*) + *i* *s**i**n*(2*θ*))

which, in turn, implies that

−1= (*c**o**s*(2*θ*) + *i* *s**i**n*(2*θ*))

The geometric question becomes what rotations when doubled result in 180
degrees or π? The roots are *θ* = π/2 and θ= 3π/2, giving the roots *i*
and –*i*. In other words, every nonzero complex number has *n* distinct
*n*th roots, which divides the circle evenly. For example, the
8<sup>th</sup> root of 1 divides the unit circle into eighths equal
rotations of 45 degrees or π/4.

*i*

$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}( - 1 + i)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(1 + i)$

−1 1

$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}( - 1 - i)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(1 - i)$

*–i*

There is only one natural way to extent the real-valued functions to the
complex numbers.

*e*<sup>*a* + *i**b*</sup> = *e*<sup>*a*</sup>*e*<sup>*i**b*</sup> = *e*<sup>*a*</sup>\[(*c**o**s*(*b*)+ *i* *s**i**n*(*b*)\]

This formula tells us that the Polar coordinates for
*e*<sup>*a* + *i**b*</sup> is given by a radius equal to *e<sup>a</sup>*
and central angle θ = *b.*

Euler’s equation is not fundamentally creative because it is an identity
of quantities, but because it is a bold conceptual conjecture that
unifies previously separate mathematical domains—the domain of
trigonometry and the domain of complex or imaginary numbers by means of
interlacing the power series expansions for *sin*(x) and *cos*(x) and
the exponential function *e<sup>x</sup>* expanded to include imaginary
components to the exponents. Euler’s discovery is the result of creating
a mathematical context which satisfies mathematical desiderata due to
the following facts:

-   There is only one natural way to extend the real-valued exponential
    function to the complex numbers.

-   The exponential function “contains” the sine and cosine functions
    “implicitly” but the unification comes by expanding exponents to
    complex numbers.

-   The most significant benefit of working in context of the complex
    numbers, as opposed to real numbers, is that every arithmetic
    equation (i.e., polynomial) has a solution—in fact, it systematizes
    the theory of polynomials giving the elegant result that an
    *n*-degree polynomial has *n* roots.

Innocence”

As we have seen much of the development of mathematics can be seen as
the development of number systems. These number systems emerge out of
everyday experiences with counting, accounting, dividing, measuring, and
rotating. Patterns in the world are a catalyst for Platonistic
mathematical reflection—why is the Fibonacci sequence:

1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ….

so “fascinatingly prevalent” (H. S. M. Coxeter, *Introduction to
Geometry*) in nature? Lilies have 3 petals, buttercups 5, some
delphiniums 8, marigolds 13, asters 21, and daises have 34, 55, or even
89 petals. Why do the pyramids of Egypt, the chambered nautilus, the
star in the pentagon, the segments of our fingers, the limit of the
ratios of successive Fibonacci numbers all exhibit the golden ratio φ?
The beauty of mathematics and its intricate interconnections suggest
something deeper than mere empirical generalization.

Platonism, moreover, doesn’t give us a way to improve mathematical
abilities or a coherent pedagogy of mathematics—if memory is all there
is to learning, then remembering is the key to becoming a better
mathematician. If Platonic picture is the right one, then some of us
have the math meme and others don’t. Don’t bother trying to learn
mathematics, if don’t have the meme you’ll just scream. Platonism,
however, rightly points out that the patterns of mathematics are only
imperfectly reflected in the empirical world and that the finite poverty
of empirical stimulus is not sufficient to account for the infinity of
mathematical knowledge. Platonism becomes mathematically grounded in the
interaction between formalism and logicism.

These abstract properties are first formalized as laws which are then
hierarchically arranged as axioms from which theorems can be proved
using deductive logic. This is the seductive model of mathematics we
derive from Euclid’s *Elements*. Mathematics as a system of first truths
and theorems. Mathematics yields certain knowledge and knowledge that is
*a priori* or justified independently of sense experience.

Formalization is not sufficient to capture the mathematical experience,
nor is formalization in itself sufficient to guarantee logical
consistency. Frege, for example, was able to formalize a great deal of
arithmetic but he had to logically construct the set of natural numbers
to ensure that there was such a consistent mathematical object. It is
not enough to intuit that the Peano Postulates are true of the natural
numbers in Plato’s heaven. The Peano Postulates in Frege’s foundational
system were proven as theorems about a logical construction. The logical
construction was supposed to exhibit a set theoretical object whose
existence established the consistency of the postulates and whose
construction shed light on the inherent properties of the natural
numbers.

In order to guarantee that the formal laws of the various numbers
systems do not lead to contradiction, more complex numbers systems are
logically constructed as equivalences classes of simpler number systems,
and eventually, the natural numbers are constructed as set theoretical
objects for which the Peano’s Postulates are no longer accepted as mere
*postulates* but instead are derived as *theorems* within a foundational
system such as ZF set theory.

This development is a dynamic interaction between diverse philosophies
of mathematics—empiricism and Platonism, formalism and intuitionism,
logicism and mathematical creationism, in which, in the words of Cantor,
“the essence of *mathematics* is *freedom*.” This interaction suggests
another approach to the philosophy of mathematics. This approach does
not merely choose among the competing philosophies of mathematics to
explain mathematics, but instead looks to mathematical experience to
enrich our philosophizing about mathematics.

-   The complex numbers, unlike the real numbers, has a geometry forming
    a two-dimensional plane—thus allowing for the combination of
    geometry and the differential calculus, the mathematical study of
    the patterns of continuous motion and change.

-   A complex function associates with each point in the complex plane a
    “height” which is a complex number and the “landscape” you get in
    this way can provide insight into mathematical problems—including
    the pattern of the primes.

The natural numbers are points in the complex plane—all the integers
lying on the positive half of the x-axis. By studying the properties of
the complex plane, mathematicians can sometimes deduce facts about the
natural numbers. The *Riemann Hypothesis* is just this sort of problem
in analytic number theory.

How can we find a function that provides information about the primes?
The story begins with Euler who in 1740 introduced the zeta function.

$$\sum\_{n = 1}^{\infty}{\frac{1}{n^{s}}\\} = \\\frac{1}{1^{s}} + \\\frac{1}{2^{s}} + \\\frac{1}{3^{s}} + \\\ldots$$

When s <u>&lt;</u> 1, the sum is *infinite* and so divergent, but when s
&gt; 1, the sum is *finite* and so convergent. Intuitively, when s &gt;
1, the denominator grows fast enough to that even if you are adding
infinitely many terms, the terms diminish rapidly enough to result in a
finite sum.

What does the zeta function have to do with the primes?

The Euler Product Formula (1740)

$$\zeta(s) = \\\prod\_{p\\is\\prime}^{}\frac{1}{1 - \\p^{- s}}$$

can be derived from the Riemann Zeta function using the idea of the
*Sieve of Eratosthenes*.

Given the zeta function’s infinite sum, we first “factor out” all the
denominators with factors of the first prime 2. We do this by
multiplying the infinite series by a factor of

$$\frac{1}{2^{s}}$$

$$\frac{1}{2^{s}}\zeta(s) = \\\frac{1}{2^{s}} + \\\frac{1}{4^{s}} + \\\frac{1}{6^{s}} + \\\ldots$$

Next we subtract this multiplied series from the original:

$$\zeta(s) = \\1 + \frac{1}{2^{s}} + \\\frac{1}{3^{s}} + \\\frac{1}{4^{s}} + \frac{1}{5^{s}} + \\\frac{1}{6^{s}} + \frac{1}{7^{s}} + \frac{1}{8^{s}} + \ldots$$

Notice that this subtraction removes all the denominators that have a
factor of 2:

$$\left( 1 - \frac{1}{2^{s}} \right)\zeta(s) = \\1 + \frac{1}{3^{s}} + \frac{1}{5^{s}} + \frac{1}{7^{s}} + \frac{1}{9^{s}} + \frac{1}{11^{s}} + \frac{1}{12^{s}} + \ldots$$

Next we multiply both sides using the next prime raised to the power *s*
as the denominator:

$$\frac{1}{3^{s}}$$

$$\frac{1}{3^{s}}\left( 1 - \frac{1}{2^{s}} \right)\zeta(s) = \\\frac{1}{3^{s}} + \frac{1}{9^{s}} + \frac{1}{15^{s}} + \frac{1}{21^{s}} + \frac{1}{27^{s}} + \frac{1}{33^{s}} + \ldots$$

which allows us to “factor out” the terms whose denominators have a
factor of the prime 3 by subtracting from the previous sum:

$$\left( 1 - \frac{1}{3^{s}} \right)\left( 1 - \frac{1}{2^{s}} \right)\zeta(s) = \\\frac{1}{5^{s}} + \frac{1}{7^{s}} + \frac{1}{11^{s}} + \frac{1}{13^{s}} + \frac{1}{17^{s}} + \frac{1}{19^{s}} + \ldots$$

Notice that now all the denominators having a factor of 3 or 2 (or both)
have been removed from the right-hand sum.

Repeating this procedure for each of the primes in turn, we can see the
right side is being systematically sieved:

$$\ldots\left( 1 - \frac{1}{11^{s}} \right)\left( 1 - \frac{1}{7^{s}} \right)\left( 1 - \frac{1}{5^{s}} \right)\left( 1 - \frac{1}{3^{s}} \right)\left( 1 - \frac{1}{2^{s}} \right)\zeta(s) = 1$$

Dividing both sides by the all products on the left to get ζ(*s*) by
itself we obtain:

$$\zeta(s) = \frac{1}{\left( 1 - \frac{1}{2^{s}} \right)\left( 1 - \frac{1}{3^{s}} \right)\left( 1 - \frac{1}{5^{s}} \right)\left( 1 - \frac{1}{7^{s}} \right)\left( 1 - \frac{1}{11} \right)\left( 1 - \frac{1}{13} \right)}$$

We have derived *Euler’s Product Formula*:

$$\zeta(s) = \\\prod\_{p\\is\\prime}^{}\frac{1}{1 - \\p^{- s}}$$

The Euler product converges when the real part of s is &gt; 1.

As a real-valued function, the zeta function is a 1-dimensional object
and thus has no geometric structure to help you uncover the pattern of
the primes.

To do that you need to move up two dimensions, which is the key step
that Riemann made when he replaced the real number s with complex
numbers. This was in a remarkable paper of 1859.

The *Riemann zeta function* ζ(s) is a function of a complex variable *s*
which is defined by a power series:

$$\zeta(s) = \sum\_{n = 1}^{\infty}{\frac{1}{n^{s}}\\} = \\\frac{1}{1^{s}} + \\\frac{1}{2^{s}} + \\\frac{1}{3^{s}} + \\\ldots$$

In his one and only paper on number theory, *“On the Number of Prime
Numbers Less than a Given Quantity”* (1859), Riemann wrote in eight
pages one of the most influential paper ever written. Riemann noticed
that:

1\. The zeta function could be extended to the complex plane.

2\. Euler’s product formula was only valid when the real part is greater
than 1.

3\. There is another formula for the zeta function which is valid
everywhere except for s =1.

When working with real-valued functions you can chop their parts and
combine them to get smooth functions.

The *analytic continuation theorem* (ACT) says that the situation is
completely different with complex functions. If we know the values of an
analytic function on a patch of plane, then there is exactly one way to
extend it to the whole complex plane.

Riemann wanted to prove Gauss’ conjecture that for large numbers *n*,
the density of the primes below *n* is approximately 1/ln(*n*), a result
known as the *Prime Number Theorem.* This theorem was proven by Hadamard
and de la Vasllee Poussin in 1896.

Riemann in this paper – 8 pages in length—made a bold conjecture about
the zeros of the zeta function. He began by observing that zeta(s) = 0
whenever s was one the even negative numbers were zeros -2, -4, -6,
etc….. Call these the *trivial zeros*. Then he noticed that the zeta
function must have infinitely many zeros and calculated the first 9
zeros, noticing they were all on the line *z* = ½ + *bi*, for some real
number *b*. In geometric terms, all nonreal zeros of the zeta function
lie on a straight line in the complex plane that runs vertically through
the point ½ on the x-axis—known as the *critical line*.

Riemann showed that if all the complex zeros of the zeta function have
real part equal to ½, then the degree to which the density function
differs from the curve 1/ln(*n*) varies in a systematically random
proportion…. Even though you can’t predict when the next prime will
occur the overall pattern of primes is extremely regular (analogy: coin
flipping).

With the single exception of z = 1, we can calculate this function.

The zeta function converges when the real part of *s* is greater than 1.
Euler’s product formula is the special case when *s* = 1, and makes the
connection between the harmonic series and the infinity of the primes.

Now ζ(1) is the harmonic series

$$\zeta(1) = \\\sum\_{n = 1}^{\infty}{\frac{1}{n}\\} = \\1 + \\\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{7} + \\\ldots$$

and so we have a concise way of expressing the harmonic series as the
product of all primes of the form 1/(1− 1/*p*):

$$\prod\_{p\\is\\prime}^{}\frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{p}} = \\\frac{2}{1}\\ \times \\\frac{3}{2} \times \\\frac{5}{4}\\ \times \\\frac{7}{6}\\ \times \\\frac{11}{10}\\ \times \ldots\\ \times \\\frac{p}{p - 1}\\ \times \ldots$$

This identity gives us another proof of the infinity of the primes.

$$1 + \frac{1}{2} + \\\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{5} + \\\ldots + \\\frac{1}{n} + \ldots = \\\frac{2}{1}\\ \times \\\frac{3}{2} \times \\\frac{5}{4}\\ \times \\\frac{7}{6}\\ \times \\\frac{11}{10}\\ \times \ldots\\ \times \\\frac{p}{p - 1}\\ \times \ldots$$

The infinite sum of the harmonic series, we have already proven,
diverges to infinity and so the left hand side is infinite. Now assume
that the number of primes is finite. Then the right hand side of the
equation would be finite. Contradiction. Therefore, the number of primes
must be infinite. This completes an alternative proof of Euclid’s
theorem about the infinity of the premise.

The next step in this development involves what we might call the
“mathematics of philosophy”—the meta-mathematical approach elaborated by
Hilbert, but masterfully and creatively deployed by Kurt Gödel. This
approach to mathematics not only yielded profound mathematical results
but yielded mathematical theorems which had profound consequences for
philosophy and for formalist approaches to mathematics. This
intellectual symphony by Gödel was a decisive turn from the philosophy
of mathematics (the use philosophy to explain and clarify mathematics)
to the use of mathematical methods to obtain philosophical results (the
“mathematics of philosophy”).

*Conjecture*: The hitherto unprovability of the Riemann Hypothesis is
related to Chaitin’s complexity interpretation of Gödel Incompleteness:
since prime numbers can be used to code up information of arbitrary
complexity, if you were able to predict the primes with Reimann-like
constraints, then you would be able to decode information of arbitrarily
high complexity, which is a contradiction.

[1] It seems like voodoo economics to say that a debt of $5 multiplied a
negative 5 times is equal to a positive $25. It’s like saying that some
persons are so *negative* that when they finally *leave* it seems like
someone has arrived!

[2] The Harvard mathematician and satirical song writer Tom Lehrer put
the definition of the derivative to music to a tune “There’ll Be Some
Changes Made.”

You take a function of *x* and you call it *y*,

Take any *x<sub>0</sub>* that you care to try.

You make a little change and call it δ*x*,

The corresponding change in *y* is what you find nex’,

And then you take the quotient, and now carefully

Send δ*x* to zero and I think you’ll see

That what the limit gives us, if our work all checks,

Is what we call $\frac{dy}{dx}.$ Is just $\frac{dy}{dx}!$

[3]

[4] Leibniz was proud of his discovery (1674) of the quadrature or
Leibniz-Gregory series (Gregory discovered the series in 1671):

$\frac{\pi}{4} = 1 - \\\frac{1}{3} + \\\frac{1}{5} - \\\frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{9} - \frac{1}{11} + \frac{1}{13} - \ldots$
+

In an infinitely-approximating way, the series provided a “solution” to
the classic geometrical problem of squaring the circle. But Leibniz’s
series is practically useless in calculating the digits of π--not only
does it converges extremely slowly but it does not yield digits that are
*stable*. For example, if you compute the first five terms of the series
then the partial sum is 0.8349206, which is within 1/11 of the true
value of $\frac{\pi}{4}$, but not a single digit of the partial sum is
correct!
