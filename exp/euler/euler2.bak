*Minus times minus is plus.*

*The reason for this we need not discuss.*

— W. H. <span class="smallcaps">Auden</span>

Skepticism about the negative numbers persisted until the 18th century.
Negative numbers are often explained in terms of debt. If Abe owes
Beatrice $3 dollars and Calliope $7, but he has only $5, then Abe is in
debt $5 or he has, so to speak, a negative $5. Now if Abe is in debt for
$5 five times over, then Abe has, so to speak, a negative $25 dollars.
This way of think raises a puzzle: suppose Abe is in debt $5 and
negative five times. How does it make sense to say that Abe is now out
of debt and in fact has a positive profit of $25?

Euler himself in his *Algebra* (1770), used the analogy of debt, but did
not fall into the usually mistake of trying to explain that the product
of two debts must be positive. Instead, Euler gave a negative
"explanation" of why "minus times minus is plus" by considering
logically exhaustive cases: *– a × – b* cannot be *– ab* since this what
is given by *– a × b* and the change in sign of *b* should give a change
in sign of the answer. Therefore, Euler argued, *– a × – b* must *ab.*
Notice that Euler’s argument doesn’t give an *explanation* of why a
negative times a negative is a positive, but instead gives a
*systematic* argument for why the product of two negative can’t be
assigned a negative.

Where do negative numbers come about conceptually in mathematics? They
come from wanting to have solutions to equations such as

*x* + 1 = 0 .

A skeptical argument about *negative* numbers goes like this. The
left-hand side of the equation is the *successor* of the number *x*. The
right-hand side is zero. However, according to Peano’s postulates, zero
is not the successor of any natural number.

The logicist answers this skeptical conservatism about negative numbers
by *logical construction.* The logicist constructs negative numbers as a
set of ordered pairs of natural numbers. First, one defines an
equivalence relation between ordered pairs of natural numbers as
follows:

(*a*, *b*) ≈ (*c*, *d*) ↔ *a* + *d* = *b* + *c*

The integers are then defined as the equivalence classes induced by this
relation. One can define the operations of addition and multiplication
for integers in terms of the corresponding operations for natural
numbers.

(*a*, *b*) ⊕ (*c*, *d*) ↔ (*a* + *c, b + d*)

(*a*, *b*) ⊗ (*c*, *d*) ↔ (*ac + bd, ad + bc*)

The integers have the satisfying property, lacking in the natural
numbers, of being closed under the operation of *subtraction*.

Negative numbers can be obtained from the positive numbers by
multiplying by −1. Geometrically speaking, this is a rotation of 180
degrees along the number line for the natural numbers, which are now
extended in the negative direction.

The puzzle about justifying the law that a "negative times a negative is
a positive" by finding an interpretation for multiplying debts is based
on an inadequate conception of a negative number. A more general way of
thinking about negative numbers is that multiplying by – 1 indicates
changing direction on the number line. To add – 5 and – 6 is to continue
on the number line from the origin in the negative direction for a total
of 11 units. To multiply – 5 by 6 to go 5 × 6 = 30 units in the negative
direction. However, to multiply – 5 by – 6 is to multiply 5 by 6
changing directions twice and ending up on the positive direction.
Skepticism towards negative numbers can now be dismissed as
philosophical confusion of thinking of negative numbers too literally in
terms of debt.

The construction of imaginary numbers from real numbers can be done in a
way that is completely analogous to the construction of negative numbers
from natural numbers.

*Imaginary i times i is minus one.*

*Rotation is how this can be done!*

Similar conceptual puzzles arise from thinking of the imaginary number
$i = \sqrt{- 1}$ as a quantity. Where does the imaginary number
$\sqrt{- 1}$ come about conceptually in mathematics? The number from
wanting to have solutions to equations such as

*x<sup>2</sup>* + 1 = 0 .

The imaginary number *i* is defined to be $\sqrt{- 1}$. The question
arises whether $\sqrt{- 1}$ is *really* a number. Leibniz waxed mystical
when it came to this question: "The Divine Spirit found a sublime outlet
in that wonder of analysis, that portent of the ideal world, the
amphibian between being and not-being, which we call the imaginary root
of negative unity."[1]

A skeptical argument comes from the axioms for real numbers. The skeptic
about *imaginary* numbers can argue that this equation can have no real
solutions: the square of any real number, positive or negative, is
positive. Therefore, first term of (2) can never be equal to −1 and so
there are no real solutions to the equation. Euler in his *Algebra*
(1770) expressed his skepticism as follows:

> All such expressions as $\sqrt{- 1\\},\\\sqrt{- 2\\}$, etc., are
> consequently impossible or imaginary numbers, since they represent
> roots of negative quantities, and of such numbers we may truly assert
> that they are neither nothing, nor greater than nothing, nor less than
> nothing, which necessarily constitutes them imaginary or impossible.

The logicist answers this skeptical conservatism about imaginary numbers
by *logical construction.* The logicist constructs imaginary numbers as
a set of ordered pairs of real numbers. One can define the operations of
addition and multiplication for complex numbers in terms of the
corresponding operations for natural numbers.

(*a*, *b*) ⊕ (*c*, *d*) ↔ (*a* + *c, b + d*)

(*a*, *b*) ⊗ (*c*, *d*) ↔ (*ac* − *bd, ad + bc*)

Note that these definitions for addition and multiplication of complex
numbers are formally identical to the above definitions for addition of
multiplication of integers except for the negative sign (here indicated
in red).

By convention a complex number is expressed as *a* + *ib*, where *a* is
the real component and *b* the imaginary component of the complex
number. *Notice that the plus sign doesn’t really signify addition.* The
plus sign is merely used to separate the real and imaginary components,
and so it may be less confusing to simply use an ordered pair of real
numbers to represent a complex number.

What does *i* *x* *i*=  − 1 mean in terms of rotation? If multiplying by
−1 is a rotation of 180 degrees or π radians, then, geometrically
speaking, multiplication by *i* is represented by that rotation such
that two successive rotations is equal to −1. In other words, a rotation
by *i* can be represented by a rotation of 90 degrees or π/2 radians.

Complex numbers are conventionally plotted on the Argand plane. The real
component of a complex number is plotted along the *x*-axis and the
imaginary component is plotted along the *y*-axis. As we have seen,
multiplying −1, is, by geometrically speaking, a rotation of 180 degrees
or π radians. To geometrically represent *i*, we need a transformation
which when applied to itself result in a multiplication by −1 or a
rotation of π radians. By convention, a counterclockwise) rotation
(CCW)of 90 degrees or π/2 radians is a natural way to represent this
transformation. Repeated CCW rotations of 90 degrees of π/2 result in
the cycle of values *i<sup>1</sup>* = *i*, *i<sup>2</sup>* = −1,
*i<sup>3</sup> =* −*i*, *i<sup>0</sup>* = *i<sup>4</sup> =* 1. This
cycle of values is the conceptual clue to why the imaginary number *i*
in the exponent of Euler’s equation is related to rotation in the
geometric representation of complex numbers.

We still need to find the conceptual connection between imaginary
numbers a trigonometry. The values for trigonometric functions are
proportional for all similar triangles, so it is convenient to represent
these values within a circle of radius 1. Rather than using a pair of
*Cartesian coordinates* to specify a point (*x*, *y*), it is more
natural to use *polar coordinates* specified by a central angle θ and a
radius *r* = $\sqrt{x^{2} + \\y^{2}}.\\$ When confining our attention to
the unit circle, the trigonometric functions are defined in terms of θ.
The Pythagorean theorem, for example, can be expressed by the
trigonometric equation:

1 = cos<sup>2</sup>(θ) + sin<sup>2</sup>(θ) .

The values of cos(θ) are read on the *x*-axis and the values of sin(θ)
are read on the *y*-axis for a right triangle whose right angle is
formed perpendicular to the *x*-axis and whose hypotenuse is a radius
from the origin to the unit circle.

*sin*(θ)

−1 0 *cos*(θ) 1

One of the unsymmetrical properties of real numbers is that positive
numbers have two square roots, whereas negative numbers have none. All
real numbers have exactly one cube root, fifth root, and so on. One of
the elegant properties of working in context of the complex numbers, as
opposed to real numbers, is that every arithmetic equation or polynomial
has a solution—in fact, within the complex numbers every *n*-degree
polynomial has exactly *n* roots.

The formula that connects complex number with trigonometry is *De
Moive’s formula*

(cos *x* + *i*sin *x*)<sup>*n*</sup>= cos (*n**x*)+ *i* *s**i**n*(*n**x*)
.

De Moive’s formula follows from Euler’s trigonometric equation

*e*<sup>*i**x*</sup> = cos (*x*)+ *i*sin (*x*).

for a complex exponent *z* = *x* + *iy*:

*e*<sup>*z*</sup>= *e*<sup>*x* + *i**y*</sup>= *e*<sup>*x*</sup> *e*<sup>*i**y*</sup>= *e*<sup>*x*</sup> (cos *y* + *i*sin *y*)  .

As real-valued functions, exponentiation and trigonometry are
*incompatible*, but here they are *unified* within the complex numbers.
Since exponential functions have the property that

(*e*<sup>*i**π*</sup>)<sup>*n*</sup>= *e*<sup>*n**i**π*</sup>

we also have *De Moivre’s theorem*:

(*cos* θ + *i sin* θ)*<sup>n</sup>* = *cos*(*n*θ) + *i sin*(*n*θ) .

This theorem overcomes the anomaly within the real numbers that, for
example, $\sqrt{1\\}\\$has two roots <u>+</u>1, whereas all *negative*
numbers have no roots but all positive real numbers have exactly one
cube root, exactly one fifth root, etc. for all the *odd* roots. This
irregular behavior is, to the mathematical mind, inelegant. De Moivre’s
theorem states, for example, the roots of $\sqrt{- 1\\}$ are solutions
to:

(*cos* θ + *i sin* θ)*<sup>2</sup>* = *cos*(2θ) + *i sin*(2θ) = −1 .

Geometrically becomes the question: which angles, when doubled, give
−1 or an angle of π = 180 degrees? The two angles are π/2 = 90 degrees
and 3π/2 = − *π*/<!-- -->2 = 270 degrees, which correspond to
respectively to *i* and –*i*.

In general, there will be exactly *n* roots for the *n*th root of –1
because the unit circle can be equally divided into *n* evenly spaced
parts. Here is a diagram for the eight roots of –1 which divide the unit
circle in two eight arcs of π/4.

*i*

It happens there is only one natural way to extend the real-valued
functions to the complex numbers.

*e*<sup>*x* + *i**y*</sup> = *e*<sup>*x*</sup>*e*<sup>*i**y*</sup> = *e*<sup>*x*</sup>\[(*c**o**s*(*y*)+ *i* *s**i**n*(*y*)\]

This formula tells us that complex numbers have two geometric
representations—a point with Cartesian coordinates (*x, y*) and point
with radius *e<sup>x</sup>* = *r* = $\sqrt{x^{2} + y^{2}}$and central
angle θ which is the angle *x + iy* makes with the *x*-axis.

A convenient way to multiply vectors is to use *polar coordinates*
instead of Cartesian coordinates, a method that will yield *geometric*
insight into the mathematical connections with *chaos.* The polar
coordinates of a point (*x*, *y*) in the Cartesian coordinate plane is
given by (***r***, θ), where radial distance *r* = |*z*| =
$\sqrt{x^{2} + \\y^{2}}$ and θ is the central angle. We have the
following trigonometric identities:

*z* = *x* + *iy* = (*r cos*θ + *r* *i sin*θ) = *r*(*cos*θ + *i sin*θ)
=|*z*|(*cos*θ + *i sin*θ) .

<img src="./attachments/euler2/media/image2.gif"
style="width:2.19167in;height:2in"
alt="Macintosh HD:Users:gary:Desktop:addtrig.gif" />

Given polar coordinates is easy to *multiply* two vectors:

*z* = |*z*|(*cos*θ + *i sin*θ)

*w* = |*w*|(*cos*φ + *i sin*φ)

by simply *multiplying* their radial distances and *adding* their
angles:

*z* × *w* = |*z*| × |*w*| \[*cos*(θ + φ) + *i sin*(θ + φ)\] .

**Fig**. **9.** Polar coordinates provide geometric insight into the
connection

between trigonometric squaring, angle doubling and chaos.

We suggest terminology of *versimilitude* for the *length* of the truth
vector *r* = |*z*| = $\sqrt{x^{2} + \\y^{2}}$ and the *spin* for the
clockwise or counter-clockwise *direction* of its central angle θ.

Whereas *skew* is a *linear* dimension along the *y*-axis, *spin* is an
*angular rotation* in either the CW or CCW direction.[2]

In summary, we have show how the equations

*x* + 1 = 0

and

*x<sup>2</sup>* + 1 = 0 .

give rise to the negative and imaginary numbers, respectively. Now we
may return to the equation

*e*<sup>*i**π*</sup> + 1 = 0

and show it gives rise to the unification of trigonometry and complex
exponentiation.

# 5.6. A Conceptual Unification: Understanding Euler’s Identity 

Euler’s equation is creative, not as an identity of quantities, but as a
bold conceptual conjecture that unifies previously separate mathematical
domains—the domain of trigonometry and the domain of complex or
imaginary numbers—by a meaningful expansion of exponentiation into the
realm of imaginary numbers. Euler’s discovery is the result of creating
a mathematical context which satisfies mathematical desiderata that
every *n*-degree polynomial has exactly *n* roots. In fact the extension
to the complex numbers provides a unification that is not apparent when
restricted to the real numbers.

Recall that we noticed that the infinite trigonometric power series:

$$\sin{(x)} = x - \\\frac{x^{3}}{3!} + \\\\\frac{x^{5}}{5!} - \\\frac{x^{7}}{7!}\\\\ + \\\frac{x^{9}}{9!} - \\\frac{x^{11}}{11!} + \ldots$$

$$\cos{(x)} = 1 - \\\frac{x^{2}}{2!} + \\\\\frac{x^{4}}{4!} - \\\frac{x^{6}}{6!} + \frac{x^{8}}{8!} - \frac{x^{10}}{10!} + \ldots$$

correspond to the odd and even summands in the power series for the
exponential function. We can in fact show this to be precisely the case
by introducing *imaginary* exponentiation:

$$e^{ix} = 1 + ix + \\\frac{{(ix)}^{2}}{2!} + \\\frac{({ix)}^{3}}{3!} + \\\frac{{(ix)}^{4}}{4!} + \\\frac{{(ix)}^{5}}{5!} + \frac{{(ix)}^{6}}{6!}\\ + \ldots + \frac{{(ix)}^{n}}{n!} + \ldots$$

$$e^{ix} = \left( 1 - \\\frac{x^{2}}{2!} + \\\\\frac{x^{4}}{4!} - \\\frac{x^{6}}{6!} + \frac{x^{8}}{8!} - \frac{x^{10}}{10!} + \ldots \right) + i\left( x - \\\frac{x^{3}}{3!} + \\\\\frac{x^{5}}{5!} - \\\frac{x^{7}}{7!}\\\\ + \\\frac{x^{9}}{9!} - \\\frac{x^{11}}{11!} + \ldots \right)$$

*e*<sup>*i**x*</sup> = cos (*x*)+ *i* *s**i**n*(*x*)

Finally, for *x* = π, *cos*(π) = −<!-- -->1 and *sin*(π) = 0, so we have
derived Euler’s elegant equation:

*e*<sup>*i**π*</sup> + 1 = 0 .

This beautiful equation connects the ideas of *imaginary numbers* *i*
and *rotations* in terms of π to *imaginary* *exponentiation* in a way
that unifies *complex numbers, trigonometry,* and, as we shall see,
*computation*.

# 5.7. From Truth Values to Truth Vectors.

# 

Rather than thinking of truth as measured *linearly* (as in done in
Tarski’s and Rescher’s schemas) as its absolute distance from 1 within
the interval \[0, 1\], we can think of measuring truth in terms of *two*
*dimensions*: its *degree* of *veridicality* or *accuracy* and its
*skew* or *spin*. The natural mathematical representation of such an
entity not a single *truth* *value* but a two-dimensional *truth*
*vector **c*** = ***v*** + *i**s***.

First, we extend the range of values for ***v*** from the real-valued
interval \[1, 0\] representing *degrees of truth* to the real-valued
interval \[1, −1\] representing *degrees of accuracy* or inaccuracy. In
ordinary language, to be *inaccurate* is more than merely *lacking
accuracy* but to be positively misleading. Here the value ***v*** ranges
from ***v*** = 1 for complete accuracy and ***v*** = −1 for complete
inaccuracy.

Secondly, we include a scale for measuring skew ranging from *i* to
–*i*. (One way of thinking about the *imaginary value* *i* =
$\sqrt{- 1}$, is to use Zedah’s proposed reading as "*fairly (CCW)
skewed.*") From a mathematical point of view, we have *truth vectors*
***c*** = ***v*** + *i**s***, where the value ***v*** stands for the
degree of *veridicality* or *accuracy* and the value ***s*** stands for
the degree of *skew*. These vectors can be combined by the standard
rules for vector addition and multiplication.

Thirdly, to make our graphs more intuitive, we shall sometimes plot the
degree of veridicality along the *vertical* axis and the degree of skew
along the *horizontal* axis. Other times we use the standard
conventions.

*completely accurate*

*–i* *i*

*completely skewed to the left completely skewed to the right*

The unit circle for two-dimensional truth vectors

Functions involving imaginary number often involve rotation and produce
waves and so have proved, in terms of applications in physics, to be
quite useful.

*Example 1.* *Vector addition.* Suppose we have three media outlets
measured by two-dimensional vectors with a parameter ***v*** for
veridicality or accuracy and another parameter ***s*** for skew. Suppose
a random poll measures the accuracy and skew of the political views of
MSNBC viewers and FOX viewers and finds them to be as follows:

-   MSNBC viewers have beliefs that are 40% accurate and 50% skewed a
    *liberal* direction.

-   FOX viewers have views that are 80% *inaccurate* and 80% skewed in
    the *conservative* direction.

-   Polling reveals that the public’s political views are 50% accurate
    with a conservative skew of 20%.

Assume that truth vector for public opinion results from the vector
*sum* of the truth vectors for these three media outlets. Calculate the
truth vector (i.e., the *accuracy* and *skew*) of NPR.

*Solution*: NPR’s coverage is estimated to be 90% accurate with a
liberal spin of 10%.

*Example 2. A Fixed-Point Theorem for Truth Vectors*

Suppose that there are two media outlets—a blue station espousing a
liberal point of view and a red station espousing a conservative point
of view. Using a unit circle we can plot the dynamic states of truth
vectors operating on, or influencing, the state of public opinion. We
can plot the state of public opinion using a vert*i*cal axis for
*veridicality* and a *horizontal* axis for political *spin*. The
veridicality axis ranges from

*i* (completely *accurate* information) to –*i* (completely inac*c*urate
misinformation). The horizontal axis ranges from –1 (complete liberal or
*left*-wing politics) to 1 (complete conservative *right*-wing
politics).

*i* = completely accurate

*–* 1 = completely liberal (left) 1 = completely conservative (right)

*–i* = completely inaccurate

The state of public opinion can be represented by a vector, for example,
by the vector whose coordinates are say - 0.4 for accurate information
and 0.3 for political spin in the conservative direction.

Given this, or any state of public opinion, and assuming the blue
station aims at completely liberal broadcasting and the red station aims
at completely conservative broadcasting, what additional broadcasting to
the blue station and what additional broadcasting to the red station is
required so that the balance of opinion as computed by the midpoint
between the vectors of influence of the media outlets results in a state
of public information which is approximately close to completely
accurate information?

We can prove a fixed-point theorem that answers this question. First, we
illustrate this fixed-point theorem with a classic puzzle due to George
Gamow that demonstrates the power of complex numbers.

<span class="smallcaps">Imagining Gamow’s Treasure</span>. There is
hidden treasure on an island on which there are two palm trees. To find
the hidden treasure, Captain Jack Sparrow must count his paces from the
grave of Davey Jones to the palm tree on the left, turn 90 degrees
clockwise, pace the same distance, and then plant a flag. Returning to
the grave, Captain Jack must count his paces to the palm tree on the
right, turn 90 degrees counterclockwise, pace the same distance, and
then plant a second flag. The treasure is to be found midway between the
two flags. The problem is that the location grave of Davey Jones is
unknown. How can Captain Jack Sparrow still find the hidden treasure?

*Solution*: Assign coordinates to the palm trees. The palm tree on the
left is assigned (–1,0) and the palm tree on the right is assigned
(1,0). We will show that no matter where the grave is, the treasure is
buried at (0, 1).

In the diagram below, the vector G from the Davey Jones’s Grave ☠ to the
origin is yellow. The vector from the Grave ☠ to the palm tree at (-1,
0) is blue. The vector to from the Grave ☠ to the palm tree at (1, 0) is
red.

(−<!-- -->1,0) *G* (1,0)

☠

The usefulness of imaginary numbers is this: the multiplication by *i*
of a vector in the complex plane results in a 90 degree
counter-clockwise (CCW) turn, and multiplication by – *i* results in a
90 degrees clockwise (CW) turn.

To plot where the first flag is planted, we first translate to blue
vector to an origin at (–1, 0) and multiply the transformed vector by
–*i*. Notice that the transplanted vector ends up at \[(G – 1 ) – 1\],
and so the location of the first flag is –*i* \[(G – 1 ) – 1\]:

🏳 −*i*\[(*G* − 1) − 1)\]

\[(*G* − 1) − 1)\]

90<sup>∘</sup>*C**W*=  × −*i*

(−<!-- -->1,0) (1,0)

*G*

☠

Similarly, we translate the red vector to \[(*G* + 1) + 1\] with an
origin at (1, 0) and then multiply by *i* to determine where the second
flag is planted.

🏳 −*i*\[(*G* − 1) − 1)\]

🏳 *i*\[(*G* + 1) + 1\]

\[(*G* − 1) − 1)\]

90<sup>∘</sup>*C**W*=  × −*i* 90<sup>∘</sup> *C**C**W* = ×*i*

(-1,0) (1,0)

*G*

☠

Now we can find the buried treasure by plotting the *midpoint* of the
line between the two flags:

🏳 −*i*\[(*G* − 1) − 1)\]

🏳*i* \[(*G* + 1) + 1\]

\[(*G* − 1) − 1)\]

90<sup>∘</sup>*C**W*=  × −*i* 90<sup>∘</sup> *C**C**W* = ×*i*

(-1,0) (1,0)

*G*

☠

Now the *midpoint* between the two flags can be computed as the
*average* of the locations:

$$\frac{- i\left\lbrack (G - 1) - 1 \right\rbrack + i\lbrack\left( G + 1) + 1 \right)\rbrack}{2} = \frac{iG - iG + 2i}{2} = \frac{2i}{2} = i$$

Notice that the vector G drops out of the equation. Therefore the
position of Davey Jones’s grave is irrelevant: we have a fixed-point
theorem. The treasure lies buried on the perpendicular bisector directly
above the origin at a distance of one half the distance between the two
palm trees.

Returning to our original problem, let’s define the *liberal
aspirational vector* to be the vector from the current state of public
opinion to (– 1, 0), which is pure liberalism, and define the
*conservative aspirational vector* to be the vector from the current
state of public opinion to (1, 0), which is pure conservatism.

*Fixed-Point Theorem*: Given any state of public opinion, if the liberal
and conservative media outlets are approximately achieving their
aspirational vectors, then the solution to moving the public towards
accurate information is to supplement media influence by vectors equal
to multiplying the liberal aspirational vector by – *i* and the
conservative aspirational vector by *i*.

In the next chapter, we use this geometric interpretation of imaginary
numbers as *rotation* unify logic with complex numbers, providing
insight into mathematical properties of chaos.

[1] Félix Klein, *Elementary Mathematics From an Advanced Standpoint:
Arithmetic, Algebra, Analysis* (1924), 56.

[2] *Verisimilitude* was a philosophical term, coined by Karl Popper
\[1976\] to capture the notion of the *deductive power* of a scientific
theory. How can one explain the paradox that *truth* is the aim of
scientific inquiry although even the greatest scientific theories in the
history of science are, strictly speaking, *false*? Popper wanted to
acknowledge the intuitive belief that, for example, Newtonian mechanics
is "closer to the truth" than Aristotelian physics even though both
theories are *false*. Popper proposed distinguishing between the *truth*
of a scientific hypothesis and its *content* in terms of the
truth-content of its logical *consequences*. Popper never succeeded in
giving a satisfactory formal account. Here we use the same term for a
different account: our *two-dimensional* proposal of truth vectors is
not, like Popper’s theory, committed to giving a *one-dimensional*
measure of "closeness to the truth."
