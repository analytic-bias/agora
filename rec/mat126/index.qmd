# Preface {.unnumbered}

## What?

This is site hosting online notes for R110 and R210, for when interactive handouts are distributed.

## Why?

They don't want to write a new textbook or reform the curriculum, so someday I will turn all of these into a new book/course, ~~by one mathematical pedagogy to rule them all,~~ with compassion and beauty, without apathy or boredom.

## Old Notes?

Those originally written in TeX, currently including the solution to both midterm exams, can be found [here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/brnvkmpfcghf#a79d19).
