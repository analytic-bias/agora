# Preface {.unnumbered}

## What?

This is site hosting online notes for R110 and R210, for when interactive handouts are distributed.

## Why?

They don't want to write a new textbook or reform the curriculum, so someday I will turn all of these into a new open textbook that retains the beauty of our field, restoring the glory of the Hellenic pedagogical traditions.

## Old Notes?

Those originally written in TeX, currently including <span style="color: red;">the solutions to both midterm exams</span>, can be found [here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/brnvkmpfcghf#a79d19).
