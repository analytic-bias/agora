# Roadmap

- Linguistic Modalities
  + Generalized Quantifiers
  + Tenses
  + Degrees of Epistemic Transitivity
- Logic 2030

  + oh does liquid tensor experiment have sequels? can we formulate more stuffs condensed, analytic, shtukas, motives, blahblah?
- Project Kanamori (might also consider a Chinese version)
