    "text": "2.1 Modes of Truth and Modal Logics\nHistorically, notions like necessity, possibility, impossibility, and contingency were thought of as modes of truth or ways in which a proposition could be true or false. Modal logic began as the study of the logic of these modes of truth.\nAristotle, in Chapter 9 of De Interpretatione, discusses modality in his famous example of the sea battle. Suppose the sea battle will be fought tomorrow. Then it was true yesterday that it would be fought tomorrow. So if all past truths are necessarily true, then it is necessarily true now that the battle will be fought tomorrow. A similar argument holds on the supposition that the sea battle will not be fought tomorrow. Aristotle proposed solving this problem of logical fatalism by denying that future contingent propositions have definite truth-values.\nUsing the ‘\\(\\Box\\)’ for ‘it is necessary that’, the principle that all necessary truths are in fact \\[\n\\Box \\mathrm{P}\\to \\mathrm{P},\\tag*{(\\textbf{T})}\n\\] but adding its converse that all truths are necessary truths: \\[\n\\mathrm{P} \\to \\Box \\mathrm{P} \\tag*{(\\textbf{V})}\n\\] collapses the notions of truth and necessary truth.\nMedieval philosophers, concerned with such theological issues as articulating the nature of the Trinity, appealed to such modal notions as essence and accident, contingency and necessity in their labyrinthine theological reflections.1 Akin to the problem is logical fatalism is the problem of theological fatalism: the problem of reconciling divine foreknowledge and human freedom. Saint Augustine (354–430) in his treatise On the Free Choice of Will considers an argument for theological fatalism proposed by Evodius. Evodius argued that “God foreknew that man would sin, that which God foreknew must necessarily come to pass.” We may set forth this argument for theological fatalism for a particular case as follows:\nSt. Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274) in his Summa Contra Gentiles (part I, chapter 67) criticized this kind of argument as resting on an amphiboly. The critical first premise “if God knew Adam would sin, then, necessarily, Adam sinned” is ambiguous between\nAquinas called (1a) the necessity of the consequence contrasting it with (1b) the necessity of the consequent. Using the ‘\\(\\Box\\)’ to abbreviate ‘it is necessary that’, the difference between these two can be made more perspicuous with symbols: \\[\n\\Box (\\mathrm{P} \\to \\mathrm{Q}) \\tag*{(1\\textit{a})}\n\\] \\[\n(\\mathrm{P} \\to \\Box \\mathrm{Q}) \\tag*{(1\\textit{b})}\n\\] Solving the famous theological problem of reconciling divine foreknowledge with human freedom may turn on exposing ambiguities of this sort.\nPerhaps the most famous theological application of modal logic is Saint Anselm’s modal ontological argument. According to Saint Anselm (1033–1109), it follows from God’s nature that it is necessary that God exists if God exists at all. Moreover, this conditional itself, being a conceptual truth, is itself necessarily true. We then have the following argument:\nUsing ‘\\({\\Large\\diamond}\\)’ for ‘it is possible that’, the above argument can be symbolized: \\[\n\\Box(G\\to\\Box G).\\quad{\\Large\\diamond} G\\quad\\therefore G\\tag*{(2)}\n\\]\nThe question of whether Anselm’s argument is valid became a precise question when various systems of modal logic were proposed and developed in the 1960s.\nGottlob Frege (1848–1925), the inventor (or discoverer) of modern predicate-quantifier logic, relegated modality to autobiographical information about the speaker, and for many years logicians only investigated extensional logic.\nOne of the most puzzling validities, at least to the beginning logical students is known as Lewis’s Dilemma: \\[\\mathrm{P}\\land\\lnot \\mathrm{P}\\to \\mathrm{Q},\\] which states “a contradiction implies anything”2. This implication follows from the inference rules of simplification, addition, and modus tollendo ponens3, which are themselves not particularly puzzling.\nThe following theorems are known as the paradoxes of material implication:\nC. I. Lewis investigated modal logic in order to find a stricter form of the conditional which would not result in such paradoxes. Lewis defined strict implication \\(\\mathrm{P}\\Rightarrow \\mathrm{Q}\\) (read “\\(\\mathrm{P}\\) strictly implies \\(\\mathrm{Q}\\)”) by combining modality with the truth-functional conditional: \\[\n\\mathrm{P}\\Rightarrow \\mathrm{Q}\\quad:=\\quad\\Box(\\mathrm{P}\\land\\lnot \\mathrm{Q}),\n\\] or alternatively, \\[\n\\mathrm{P}\\Rightarrow \\mathrm{Q}\\quad:=\\quad\\Box(\\mathrm{P}\\to \\mathrm{Q}).\n\\]\nThe notion of strict implication was characterized by such axioms as:\nThe philosopher Leibniz (1646–1716) explicitly invoked that language of possible worlds to explain the difference between necessary and contingent truths. What is logically or necessarily true are those truths truth in all possible worlds, whereas a contingent truth is one that is true in some possible worlds.\nDrawing upon this logical connection between universal and existential quantification and the modal notions of necessity and possibility, we obtain a modal version of the classical Aristotelian Square of Opposition and the duality of modal laws known as the laws of modal negation.\nIn the modern development of modal logic, logicians noticed that a host other phenomena—such as deontic notions of obligation and permissibility, epistemic notions of knowledge and belief, as well as temporal operators—share these logical relations and hence can be represented as modal logics.\nIn deontic logic, \\(\\Box\\) is read “it is morally obligatory that” and \\({\\Large\\diamond}\\) is read “it is morally permissible that”. Kant’s maxim that “ought implies can”, that is, whatever is obligatory is permissible, is captured by modal axiom (D): \\[\n\\Box \\mathrm{P} \\to{\\Large\\diamond} \\mathrm{P}.\\tag*{(\\textbf{D})}\n\\]\nIn epistemic logic, \\(\\Box\\) is read for some subject \\(S\\) “it is known that” and \\({\\Large\\diamond}\\) is read “it is believed that”. Some modal axioms for epistemic logic that have been considered include:\nThe axiom (K) expresses logical omniscience insofar as this axiom requires that the knowledge of an agent is closed under modus ponens; and hence such knowers know all the logical consequences of their knowledge.\nAxiom (T) states the truism that whatever is known is true. Notice that this axiom would be too strong for deontic logic insofar as an action’s being obligatory doesn’t imply that the agent actually performs that action.\nAxiom (4) expresses a high degree of positive introspective knowledge: if someone knows P, then she knows that she knows that \\(\\mathrm{P}\\). Axiom (E) on the other hand, expresses a high degree of negative introspective knowledge: if someone doesn’t know that \\(\\mathrm{P}\\), then he knows he doesn’t know \\(\\mathrm{P}\\). This axiom is contrary to the experience of Socrates: as the gadfly of Athens, Socrates found through his questioning that many of his fellow Athenians did not know what they were talking about but also didn’t know that they didn’t know. The gadfly of Athens believed his vocation was to sting his fellow Athenians into the awareness they were own ignorance, a service for which they did not always show adequate appreciation.\nThe temporal logic or Diodorian temporal logic was studied by the logician A. N. Prior (1914–1969). To model temporal language, we introduce a pair of modal operators for the future and a pair of modal operators for the past.\nThe axioms for minimal tense logic include version of Axiom (K) for the two necessity operators: \\[\\begin{align*}\n&{\\color{red}\\Box}(\\varphi\\to\\psi)\\to({\\color{red}\\Box}\\varphi\\to{\\color{red}\\Box}\\psi)\n&\\begin{aligned}\\text{\\textit{Whatever has always followed from what always has been,}}\\\\\\text{\\textit{always has been.}}\\end{aligned}&\n\\tag*{(K${\\color{red}\\Box}$)}\\\\\\\\\n&{\\color{green}\\Box}(\\varphi\\to\\psi)\\to({\\color{green}\\Box}\\varphi\\to{\\color{green}\\Box}\\psi)\n&\\begin{aligned}\\text{\\textit{Whatever will always follow from what always will be,}}\\\\\\text{\\textit{always will be.}}\\end{aligned}&\n\\tag*{(K${\\color{green}\\Box}$)}\n\\end{align*}\\]\nIt also contains two axioms concerning the interaction of the past and future that has the form of the so-called Brouwersche axiom with alternating valences: \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\tag*{(B${\\color{green}\\Box}{\\color{red}{\\Large\\diamond}}$)}\n&\\varphi\\to{\\color{green}\\Box}{\\color{red}{\\Large\\diamond}}\\varphi\n&\\text{\\textit{What is, will always have been}}\\\\\n\\tag*{(B${\\color{red}\\Box}{\\color{green}{\\Large\\diamond}}$)}\n&\\varphi\\to{\\color{red}\\Box}{\\color{green}{\\Large\\diamond}}\\varphi\n&\\text{\\textit{What is, has always been going to happen}}\\\\\n\\end{align*}\\]\nThe Brouwersche (B) axiom was so-named by the logician Oskar Becker (Becker 1930) after the charismatic Dutch mathematician L. E. J. Brouwer (1881–1966), who championed a philosophy of mathematics known as intuitionism. It happens that when the \\({\\Large\\diamond}\\) can be paraphrased as \\({\\Large\\diamond}\\lnot{\\Large\\diamond}\\), the resulting axiom has the form of the acceptable form of double negation in intuitionistic logic: \\[\n\\varphi\\to\\lnot{\\Large\\diamond}\\lnot{\\Large\\diamond}\\varphi\\tag*{(\\textbf{B})}\n\\]\nAccording to intuitionism, mathematical objects do not exist as eternal Platonic objects but are constructions in intuition. Intuitionists read the propositional connectives as involving not merely truth, but proof, and so they rejected such classical forms of reasoning as reductio ad absurdum and theorems such as the law of excluded middle. Intuitionists reject the following mathematical proof.\nAround the 1970s it was noticed that the famous incompleteness theorems (Gödel 1931) were propositional in character and that their logic could be captured in propositional modal logic. These modal provability logics added to Axiom (K) the following axiom, known as the Gödel-Löb axiom or also the well-ordering axiom. \\[\n\\Box(\\Box\\varphi\\to\\varphi)\\to\\Box\\varphi\\tag*{(\\textbf{W})}\n\\]\nModal Provability Logics proliferated from the 1950s–1970s, but the genesis of the idea goes back to a short note of Gödel (1933) in which he noted that intuitionistic truth is defined in terms of proof since provability is a kind of necessity. The above axiom can be read as a kind of soundness theorem.\nLater we will show how to use a modal provability logic to exhibit the propositional logic of key parts of Gödel’s First and Second Incompleteness Theorems.\nIn contemporary logic, modal logic has grown beyond these philosophical origins and is at the interface of a number of disciplines including the studies information flow and dynamics, game theory, and computability.",

    "text": "1 The theological, if not the political, roots Great Schism of 1054, which can be traced back to a disagreement about the modalities of the Persons of the Trinity. The Nicean Creed (325) uses the term homoousios (from the Greek homo = ‘same‘ and ousios = ‘essence’ or ‘substance’), in contrast to homoiousios (from the Greek homoi = ‘similar’) making the solitary i the jot and tittle of Nicean Creedal Orthodoxy. The Greek Church preferred the latter term since the former had been used by the Syrian Bishop of Antioch to espouse modal monarchism, the heresy that the Heavenly Father, Resurrected Son and Holy Spirit are not three distinct Persons, but are rather different modes or aspects of one monadic God perceived by believers as distinct persons. The Latin Church adopted the former siding with Athanasius against the heretic Arius, who denied that Jesus was co-equal and co-eternal with the Father. The Second Council of Nicea (381), among other changes, inserted the word filioque (from the Latin filio = the son, and que = “and”) into the Nicean-Constantinopolitan Creed and the Latin mass. In Latin theology, the three Persons of the Trinity are logically distinguished by the formal relations of “proceeding from” citing such proof texts as Phil. 1:9, Titus 3:6, Acts 2:33. Orthodox theology, citing the words of Jesus in proof texts such John 15:26, regarded the insertion of filioque into the Nicean-Constantipolitan creed, is as Semi-Sabellianism. The great church historian Pelikan (1988: 90) opined: “If there is a special circle of the inferno described by Dante reserved for historians of theology, the principal homework assigned to that subdivision of Hell for at least the first several eons of eternity may well be a thorough study of all the treatises… devoted to the inquiry: Does the Holy Spirit proceed from the Father only, as Eastern Christendom contends, or from both the Father and the Son as the Latin Church teaches?” In 1989 Pope John Paul II and Patriarch Demetrius knelt together in Rome and recited the Nicene Creed without the filioque.\nPelikan, J. 1988.

According to Leibniz, a sentence is necessary if it is true in every possible world, and a sentence is possible if it is true is some possible world. Kripke showed that by placing very natural conditions on a relation of relative possibility or accessibility on a set of possible worlds, the various systems of modal logic could be validated.\n\nKripke, Saul. 1959.

A modal structure \\(\\mathbb{M}\\) is an ordered triple \\(\\langle W, R,\\alpha \\rangle\\), where \\(W\\) is a set4 of possible worlds, \\(R\\subseteq W\\times W\\) is a relation known as the accessibility relation or the relative possibility relation, and \\(\\alpha\\) is a distinguished element of W known as the actual world.\nWe can exhaustively characterize the notion of \\[\\beta \\vDash \\varphi,\\] the truth of a sentence in a possible world \\(\\beta\\), by\n\nIf \\(\\varphi\\) is a sentence letter S, then \\[\n\\beta\\vDash S \\iff S\\in\\beta,\n\\] i.e. \\(S\\) is a member of \\(\\beta\\);\nIf \\(\\varphi\\) is \\(\\psi\\), then \\[\n\\beta\\vDash \\neg\\psi \\iff \\beta\\not\\vDash\\psi,\n\\] i.e., it is not the case that \\(\\beta\\vDash\\psi\\);\n\nIf \\(\\varphi\\) is \\((\\psi\\land\\chi)\\), then \\[\n\\beta\\vDash (\\psi\\land\\chi) \\iff \\beta\\vDash\\psi \\mathrel{\\&} \\beta\\vDash\\chi,\n\\] i.e., both \\(\\beta\\vDash\\psi\\) and \\(\\beta\\vDash\\chi\\);\nIf \\(\\varphi\\) is \\((\\psi\\lor\\chi)\\), then \\[\n\\beta\\vDash (\\psi\\lor\\chi) \\iff \\beta\\vDash\\psi \\mathrel{\\|} \\beta\\vDash\\chi,\n\\] i.e., either \\(\\beta\\vDash\\psi\\) or \\(\\beta\\vDash\\chi\\), or both;\nIf \\(\\varphi\\) is \\((\\psi\\to\\chi)\\), then \\[\n\\beta\\vDash (\\psi\\to\\chi) \\iff \\beta\\vDash\\psi\\implies\\chi,\n\\] i.e., if \\(\\beta\\vDash\\psi\\) then \\(\\beta\\vDash\\chi\\), or either \\(\\beta\\not\\vDash\\psi\\) or \\(\\beta\\vDash\\chi\\) ‽;\nIf \\(\\varphi\\) is \\((\\psi\\leftrightarrow\\chi)\\), then \\[\n\\beta\\vDash (\\psi\\leftrightarrow\\chi) \\iff \\beta\\vDash\\psi\\iff\\chi,\n\\] i.e., \\(\\beta\\vDash\\psi\\) if and only if \\(\\beta\\vDash\\chi\\);\n\n\nFinally, the law clause gives the Leibnizian truth conditions for necessity and possibility:\n\n\nIf \\(\\varphi\\) is \\(\\Box\\psi\\), then \\[\n\\beta\\vDash \\Box\\psi \\iff \\forall \\gamma\\in W.\\, \\beta\\mathrel{R}\\gamma \\implies \\beta\\vDash\\psi,\n\\] i.e., \\(\\psi\\) is true in all possible worlds \\(\\gamma\\), possible-relative to \\(\\beta\\);\nIf \\(\\varphi\\) is \\({\\Large\\diamond}\\psi\\), then \\[\n\\beta\\vDash {\\Large\\diamond}\\psi \\iff \\exists \\gamma\\in W.\\, \\beta\\mathrel{R}\\gamma \\implies \\beta\\vDash\\psi,\n\\] i.e., \\(\\psi\\) is true in some possible worlds \\(\\gamma\\), possible-relative to \\(\\beta\\);\n\n\nThis completes the definition of truth in a model for modal propositional logic. Using this definition of truth, we can now define what it means for a sentence to be semantically valid: \\[\n\\vDash\\varphi\\text{ (i.e., }\\varphi\\text{ is semantically valid)} \\iff \\forall\\alpha\\in W.\\, \\alpha\\vDash\\varphi.\n\\]\nNext, we obtain different systems of modal logic when various conditions are placed on the accessibility or relative possibility relation R. We say that a relation \\(R\\) is a series if \\(R\\) is serial; \\(R\\) is a reflexivity if \\(R\\) is totally reflexive; \\(R\\) is a similarity if \\(R\\) is totally reflexive and symmetric; \\(R\\) is a partial ordering if \\(R\\) is totally reflexive and transitive; \\(R\\) is an equivalence relation if \\(R\\) is totally reflexive and euclidean. It turns out that the axioms of modal logic discussed above are validated when natural conditions are imposed on the accessibility or relative possibility relation \\(R\\).\n\n\n\nTable 2.1: Properties of Accessibility\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD\n\\({\\small\\square} \\varphi \\rightarrow {\\Large\\diamond} \\varphi\\)\nserial\n\\(\\forall \\alpha.\\,\\exists \\beta.\\, \\alpha \\mathbin{R} \\beta\\)\n\n\nT\n\\({\\small\\square} \\varphi \\rightarrow \\varphi\\)\nreflexive\n\\(\\forall \\alpha.\\,\\alpha \\mathbin{R} \\alpha\\)\n\n\nB\n\\(\\varphi \\rightarrow \\square {\\Large\\diamond} \\varphi\\)\nsymmetric\n\\(\\forall \\alpha.\\, \\forall \\beta.\\, (\\alpha \\mathbin{R} \\beta \\Rightarrow \\beta \\mathbin{R} \\alpha)\\)\n\n\n4\n\\(\\square \\varphi \\rightarrow \\square \\square \\varphi\\)\ntransitive\n\\(\\forall \\alpha \\forall \\beta .\\, \\forall \\gamma.\\, (\\alpha \\mathbin{R} \\beta \\;\\&\\; \\beta \\mathbin{R} \\gamma \\Rightarrow \\alpha \\mathbin{R} \\gamma)\\)\n\n\n5\n\\({\\Large\\diamond} \\varphi \\rightarrow \\square {\\Large\\diamond} \\varphi\\)\neuclidean\n\\(\\forall \\alpha.\\, \\forall \\beta.\\, \\forall \\gamma.\\, (\\alpha \\mathbin{R} \\beta \\;\\&\\; \\alpha \\mathbin{R} \\gamma \\Rightarrow \\beta \\mathbin{R} \\gamma)\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSystems of modal logic are normal when everything derivable from necessary truths is itself necessary. This will be the case if the rule of modus ponens and axiom (K) are valid: \\[\n\\Box(\\mathrm{P}\\to \\mathrm{Q})\\to(\\Box \\mathrm{P}\\to\\Box \\mathrm{Q}).\\tag*{(\\textbf{K})}\n\\]\nAxiom K expresses the intuition that necessary truths imply only necessary truths.\nWe can conveniently summarize the above systems of modal logic in a chart. The various modal systems can be characterized by the axioms that are valid in them. The smallest normal modal logic system K contains axiom K. The four most famous modal logics are system (T) named after the Gödel–Feyes–von Wright modal logic to model tautologies, system S4 and S5, named after C. I. Lewis’s axioms for strict implications, and the unduly neglected Brouwersche system B, named by Becker after the intuitionist L. E. J. Brouwer due to the characteristic axiom’s similarity to intuitionistic double negation. All these systems contain K and T. The system D is a weaker system than T, containing axioms K and D, is named for deontic logic.\nNotice that relationships of containment among the modal systems follow from the logic of relations. Axiom B requires that R be symmetric and 4 requires that R be transitive. System S5 with axioms T and E require R to be an equivalence relation (i.e., reflexive, symmetric, and transitive); hence, S5 could also be specified by requiring axioms T, 4, and B to be valid. Therefore, S5 contains S4 and B, neither of which contains the other. Systems S5, S4 and B all contain system T, which contains D.\nA convenient way of describing these modal logics is by their Lemmon code listing the axioms valid in them. For example, \\(\\mathbf{S5} = \\mathbf{KTE} = \\mathbf{KT4B} = \\mathbf{KD4B}\\). We can represent these containment relations in a diagram in which downward paths represent containment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Logical Containment of the Modal Systems\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.2: Modal Axioms and Accessibility\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD\nDeontic Logic\nD\n\\({\\small\\square} P \\rightarrow {\\Large\\diamond} P\\)\nKD\nseriality\n\n\nT\nGödel-Feys-von Wright Tautology\nT\n\\({\\small\\square} P \\rightarrow P\\)\nKT\nreflexivity\n\n\nB\nBrouwersche System\nB\n\\(P \\rightarrow \\square {\\Large\\diamond} P\\)\nKTB\nsimilarity\n\n\nS4\nLewis’ Strict Implication System 4\n4\n\\(\\square P \\rightarrow \\square \\square P\\)\nKT4\npartial ordering\n\n\nS5\nLewis’ Strict Implication System 5\nE\n\\({\\Large\\diamond} P \\rightarrow \\square {\\Large\\diamond} P\\)\nKTE\nequivalence relation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVarious deontic modal systems can also be characterized by their axioms (Lemmon code).\n\n\n\nTable 2.3: Lemmon Codes for Deontic Modal Systems\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSystem T\nKT\nDeontic D\nKD\n\n\nSystem B\nKTB\n\n\n\n\nSystem S4\nKT4\nDeontic S4\nKD4\n\n\nSystem S5\nKTE = KT4B = KD4B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe logical relationships among the above systems of modal logic can be set forth in a diagram (due to Krister Segerberg who omits KD5 and K45). As before, a modal logic is included in another if it is connected to it, directly or indirectly, by an upward path. The second diagram is a more elaborate Picassos’ Electric Chair that includes deontic modal logics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: Hasse–Picassos Diagrams for Systems of Modal Logic\n\n\n\nOne way to visualize how the conditions on the accessibility relation validate their respective axioms is using the definitions of ‘\\(\\small\\square\\)’ and \\(\\LARGE\\diamond\\) in terms of possible worlds and use directed graphs from Chapter IV to represent the accessibility relation \\(\\mathbin{R}\\). Here the accessibility relation \\(\\alpha\\mathbin{R}\\beta\\) (read “\\(\\beta\\) is possible relative to \\(\\alpha\\)”” or “\\(\\beta\\) is accessible to \\(\\alpha\\)”) is represented by an arrow from a circle representing possible world \\(\\alpha\\) to a circle representing possible world \\(\\beta\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: Accessibility Represented by Directed Graphs\n\n\nWe can, using the directed graphs from the theory of relations, translate properties of accessibility relations into geometric properties of directed graphs. Symmetry, for example, requires that all accessibility arrows are double arrows. Reflexivity requires that every world be accessible to itself and so every world has a loop, which is a special case of a double arrow. Seriality requires that every world is a tail of an arrow. Transitivity requires that for every indirect path of accessibility from \\(\\alpha\\) to \\(\\beta\\) and from \\(\\beta\\) to \\(\\gamma\\), there is a direct path from \\(\\alpha\\) to \\(\\gamma\\). Being euclidean and serial is equivalent to being an equivalence relation, that is, being reflexive, symmetric and transitive. Expressing \\(\\mathbin{R}\\) in terms of love and worlds in terms of persons, we have the following intuitive translations:\n\n\n\nTable 2.4: Relational Properties of Directed Graphs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nserial\n\\(\\forall \\alpha.\\,\\exists \\beta.\\, \\alpha \\mathbin{R} \\beta\\)\nEveryone is a lover.\n\n\nreflexive\n\\(\\forall \\alpha.\\,\\alpha \\mathbin{R} \\alpha\\)\nEveryone is a self-lover.\n\n\nsymmetric\n\\(\\forall \\alpha.\\, \\forall \\beta.\\, (\\alpha \\mathbin{R} \\beta \\Rightarrow \\beta \\mathbin{R} \\alpha)\\)\nAll love is requited; all love is mutual.\n\n\ntransitive\n\\(\\forall \\alpha.\\, \\forall \\beta .\\, \\forall \\gamma.\\, (\\alpha \\mathbin{R} \\beta \\;\\&\\; \\beta \\mathbin{R} \\gamma \\Rightarrow \\alpha \\mathbin{R} \\gamma)\\)\nLove is transitive.\n\n\neuclidean\n\\(\\forall \\alpha.\\, \\forall \\beta.\\, \\forall \\gamma.\\, (\\alpha \\mathbin{R} \\beta \\;\\&\\; \\alpha \\mathbin{R} \\gamma \\Rightarrow \\beta \\mathbin{R} \\gamma)\\)\nAll beloveds of the same lover, love each other and themselves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the definition of truth in a modal system set forth above, we can rigorously demonstrate that if R is transitive, then axiom 4 is valid. This demonstration is carried out in the meta-language. We use the symbols ‘\\(\\forall\\)’, ‘\\(\\exists\\)’, ‘\\(\\&\\)’, ‘\\(\\implies\\)’ and ‘\\(\\in\\)’ in the meta-language for ‘all’, ‘some’, ‘and’, ‘if… then’, and ‘is an element of’, respectively. Once the truth clauses are unpacked, the logical demonstration is no more complicated than a derivation in the theory of relations.\n\n\n\nListing 2.1: Montague-style Semantic Derivation of Transitivity Validating Axiom 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above semantic derivation can be visualized graphically to prove the above result contrapositively. We will show that if \\[{\\small\\square}\\varphi\\to{\\small\\square}{\\small\\square}\\varphi\\] is false, then the accessibility relation cannot be transitive. Axiom (4) fails when its antecedent \\(\\varphi\\) is true but its consequent \\({\\small\\square}\\varphi\\) is false in α. By modal negation, \\(\\neg{\\Large\\diamond}{\\Large\\diamond}\\varphi\\) is equivalent to \\({\\Large\\diamond}{\\Large\\diamond}\\neg\\varphi\\).\nSo both \\({\\small\\square}\\varphi\\) and \\({\\Large\\diamond}{\\Large\\diamond}\\neg\\varphi\\) are true in some possible world \\(\\alpha\\). Eliminating the first \\({\\Large\\diamond}\\), we have that in some possible world \\(\\beta\\) accessible to \\(\\alpha\\) (i.e. \\(\\alpha\\mathbin{R}\\beta\\)), \\({\\Large\\diamond}\\neg\\varphi\\) is true. Applying the definition of truth for \\({\\LARGE\\diamond}\\) again, we have that for some world \\(\\gamma\\) accessible to \\(\\beta\\) (i.e. \\(\\beta\\mathbin{R}\\gamma\\)), \\(\\neg\\varphi\\) is true in \\(\\gamma\\). Notice that the transitivity of the accessibility relation \\(R\\) would require that \\(\\gamma\\) be accessible to \\(\\alpha\\), which would contradict that \\({\\small\\square}\\varphi\\). The invalidity of Axiom (4) implies the failure of the transitivity of the accessibility relation \\(R\\). Stating this result contrapositively, if the accessibility relation \\(R\\) is transitive, then axiom (4) is valid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: Kripke–Mar Diagram for Transitivity of \\(R\\) Validating Axiom (4)\n\n\n\nThe semantic demonstration together with the graphic proof using directed graphs support one another in building our intuitions for modal logic. The graphic proofs are satisfying because of their simplicity and ability to make the critical step visually perspicuous. On the other hand, the semantic proof is satisfying insofar as the explicit definitions of \\(\\small\\square\\), \\(\\LARGE\\diamond\\), \\(\\vDash\\) are shown to work elegantly and precisely with our natural deduction systems using the quantifier logic with UD, UI, EI, EG and the theory of relations. We will use the directed graphs in the context of discovering new axioms and the semantic proofs in the context of justifying that these axioms correspond to imposing requirements on the accessibility relation.\n\nExercises\nTODO… too many graphics… need some rest today…",

These logics were anticipated by (Gödel 1933a) “An interpretation of intuitionistic propositional calculus.” Gödel’s insight was that intuitionistic truth was characterized in terms of proof, which is a kind of necessity, and so modal axioms could be used to formalize the properties of provability:\n(Henkin 1952) posed the intriguing question whether the positive Gödelian sentence “I am provable” is provable. (Löb 1955) answered Henkin’s question in the affirmative by showing that Peano Arithmetic proves a counterpart to Löb’s Axiom:\nNote: adding axiom (4) turns out to be redundant. In 1975 Howard de Jongh proved that Axiom (4) is derivable from Löb’s axiom and (K) using the substitution of ‘(\\(\\square\\,P\\land P\\))’ for ‘\\(P\\)’.\nIt happens that the lemma \\[\\square \\varphi \\rightarrow \\square(\\square(\\square \\varphi \\wedge \\varphi)) \\rightarrow \\square(\\square \\varphi \\wedge \\varphi)\\] is derivable in minimal modal logic K (see exercises below).\nIt therefore follows that \\[\\square \\varphi \\rightarrow \\color{magenta}\\square(\\square \\varphi \\wedge \\varphi)\\] and hence by (T), \\[\\square \\varphi \\rightarrow \\square \\square \\varphi .\\]",

    "text": "Sachertorte at Café Reichsrat\nClassically, logic has been thought of as the study of deductive proof or derivations. In the last few decades, however, a more dynamic view of logical reasoning has emerged. Rational agents perform many cognitive reasoning tasks other than making deductions from a given set of premises. Common sense reasoning includes reasoning about the beliefs, knowledge, and logical reasoning of other agents. Reasoning is not just the construction of static derivations but dynamical events involving the flow of information based on public statements and inferences that can be made on the basis of what others know or don’t know. The following puzzle illustrates this usefulness of this kind of dynamic meta-epistemological reasoning.\nThe date was August 26, 1930. Rudolf Carnap, Herbert Feigl and Friedrich Waismann met with Gödel for Sachertore and Viennese coffee at Café Reichsrat. Gödel was excited to share with his friends his discovery. This meeting a the café was about one month before the Second Tagung for Erkentnishlehre der exackten Wissenschaften to be held in Konigsberg in September, where Gödel would make the first public announcement of his revolutionary result, the (First) Incompleteness Theorem.\nAlthough his associates from the Vienna Circle—Rudolf, Herbert, and Friedrich—could sense an undercurrent of excitement in Kurt’s manner, his cautious and measured remarks were deeper than they could, or were willing, to grasp, at that time. Rudolf decided to change the subject. “When is your birthday, Kurt?” he inquired. Gödel thought for a moment and wrote down a napkin a list of 10 dates for all to see:\nKurt said, “My birthday is one of these.” Then taking a couple more napkins, he jotted down the month of his birthday and gave it to Herbert. On the other he jotted down the date of his birthday and gave it to Friedrich. Neither Herbert nor Friedrich could see what was written on each other’s napkin.\n“Can you prove when my birthday is?” Kurt asked Herbert. The following conversation ensued.\nRudolf, who heard the exchange, correctly deduced Kurt’s birthday. How did he do this? You may assume everyone is an ideal logician: they are not lying or confused and are capable of making logically accurate inferences on the basis of the information disclosed.",

    "text": "1.2 Demystifying Euler’s Equation\n\n“An ordinary genius is a fellow that you and I would be just as good as, if we were only many times better. There is no mystery as to how his mind works. Once we understand what he has done, we feel certain that we, too, could have done it. It is different with magicians… the working of their minds is for all intents and purpose incomprehensible. Even after we understand what they have done, the process by which they have done it is completely dark.”\n—Mark Kac (1914-1984) (quoted in Nahim, p. 9)\n\nEuler’s identity, it must be admitted, appears to be the work of a magician. However, whether or not one aspires to become a first-class mathematician, it is not immediately apparent how Euler’s equation even makes sense.\nExponentiation is typically explained in terms of a repeated multiplication. For example, the number 2 raised to the exponent 3 is defined as the product of 2 multiplied by itself three times: \\[2^3=2\\times2\\times2=8.\\]\nEuler’s identity uses transcendental numbers with exponentiation. The transcendental number \\(\\pi\\) is defined as the ratio of the circumference to the diameter of a circle. Like the irrational number the \\(\\sqrt{2}\\), it is represented by an infinite non-periodic decimal; however, unlike, such algebraic irrational numbers, π is not the solution or root of any polynomial such as \\(x^2-2=0\\). The transcendental number e is defined as the base of an exponential function whose rate of change, or derivative, is equal to itself. In other words, \\(e^x\\) is the unique function such that it is its own derivative.\nNow the transcendental numbers e and π are numbers in the neighborhood of the natural numbers 2 and 3, respectively, so it makes sense to think of exponentiation as purely numerical functions. (To remember the digits of π remember the question: “May I have a large container of coffee right now?” and “To express \\(e\\) remember to remember a sentence to remember this”.) Thinking of exponentiation as a function of real numbers, we can compute: \\[{2.7182818284\\cdots}^{3.141592653\\cdots} = 23.14069262\\cdots.\\]\nHowever, Euler’s identity also includes an exponential factor of the imaginary number \\(i\\), where \\(i\\) is defined to be the positive square root of – 1. Now \\(i\\) called imaginary number because no real number can be the root of a negative number. Real numbers are either positive or negative, and a positive number times a positive is positive and a negative number times a negative is also positive. Euler in his Algebra (1770) wrote:\n\nAll such expressions as \\(\\sqrt{-1},\\ \\sqrt{-2}\\), etc., are consequently impossible or imaginary numbers, since they represent roots of negative quantities, and of such numbers we may truly assert that they are neither nothing, nor greater than nothing, nor less than nothing, which necessarily constitutes them imaginary or impossible.\n\nObviously, there must be some meaningful mathematical way of thinking of exponentiation other than as a real-valued function.\nThe Nobel physicist Richard P. Feynman called Euler’s equation “our jewel” and “the most remarkable formula in mathematics.” 1 Feynman recounts how he, as a young boy, was fascinated and in his notebooks figured out for himself, rather than taking it on authority, the mystery of why Euler’s identity was true. In Feynman’s spirit of discovery, let’s take a mathematical journey in which we figure out the meaning of Euler’s remarkable identity for ourselves—not being content with mere proofs but instead taking the time to demystify the elements of Euler’s beautiful equation.\n1 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_formula#cite_note-2The remarkable beauty of Euler’s derivation of his identity derives not only from its deep connections of five fundamental mathematical constants, but also how it illustrates the cognitive strategies mathematicians deploy they are creating or discovering mathematical truths. The last phrase “creating or discovering mathematical truths” poses an important philosophical question: do mathematicians discover mathematical truths or do they creatively construct them?\nOn this magical mystery tour, we will discover that mathematics is more than merely crunching numbers, that it is more than presenting formal proofs, and that mathematics involves such creative discoveries as:\n\nconstructing new number systems to solve previously impossible equations;\ndiscovering in geometric representations higher-level symmetries;\ntransforming anomalous singularities into systematic closure properties;\ngeneralizing arithmetic operations by expanding their mathematical meanings;\nunifying conceptual domains by making bold conjectural identifications.\n\nIn demystifying Euler’s equation, our goal is not to dispel its beauty. Indeed, by taking the time to understand how mathematicians create, we will finally come to appreciate—in a mathematically precise rather than a mystically vague way—the true beauty of Euler’s equation.",

    "text": "1.3 A Concise, but Conceptually Incomplete, Proof\n\n“It [Euler’s identity] is absolutely paradoxical; we cannot understand it, and we don’t know what it means, but we have proved it, and therefore we know it must be the truth.”\n—Benjamin Peirce (1809-1880)\n\nThe Harvard mathematician Benjamin Peirce, father of the pragmatist philosopher C. S. Peirce (1839-1914), is reported to have made the above remark after proving Euler’s identity. This quotation reminds me of a joke told by Raymond Smullyan. A mathematics professor, teaching a class of mystified undergraduates, is writing a proof on the board and claims that the theorem is “trivial.” A brave student asks why the proof is trivial. The professor turns back to the board and is lost in thought for five minutes, and then announces, “aha, yes, it is trivial!” Too often in a typical mathematics class, the lectures consist of presenting proofs to silent, of silenced, students 2 are left on their own to figure out what is going on mathematically by doing exercises.\n2 “Lecturing is the process of the transfer of knowledge from the notepad of the instructor to the notepads of the students, without ever touching the brains of either; that’s atrocious.” —Chas, M. (2023)Perhaps the students are silent because they are afraid to “look stupid” or perhaps they have learned that asking questions can be dangerous. When some student asks the professor to explain some step of the proof, perhaps the professor “explains” the proof by merely repeating the same words, maybe talking more slowly or perhaps by filling in a few details. But the students can follow the steps but they still don’t understand the mathematical ideas. This pedagogical impasse is created by the assumption that teaching mathematics is communicating formal structure or proofs. However, often understanding the mathematical ideas requires going behind the formal structure of proofs. Teaching is not merely proving theorems but communicating the mathematical ideas so that the truth of the theorem can be not only followed, but understood or comprehended, in a deeper, more intuitive, way.\nSo we have reason to be skeptical about Peirce’s pronouncement:\n\n“It [Euler’s identity] is absolutely paradoxical; we cannot understand it, and we don’t know what it means, but we have proved it, and therefore we know it must be the truth.”\n\nHere’s how Euler, in his Introduction in Analysis Infinitorum, derived his equation from the following trigonometric identity: \\[e^{ \\pm i x}=\\cos (x) \\pm \\sin (x).\\] Here if we simply substitute π for the variable \\(x\\), we have we have: \\[e^{i \\pi}=-1+0,\\] from which Euler’s identity immediately follows. This proof, while concise, is conceptually incomplete.\nBeginning the proof with a puzzling complex trigonometric equation begs the conceptual question: what does exponentiation have to do with trigonometry? After all, both the sine and cosine functions are periodic and bounded, but the exponential function is non-periodic and unbounded. How then can an exponential function like \\(e^x\\) which rapidly expands to positive infinity be defined in terms of periodic trigonometric functions whose values are confined to the interval from \\(1\\) to \\(-1\\)?",

    "text": "1.4 Making Connections/Creating Mathematics\n\n1.4.1 Connection: From Negativity to Complexity\n\n\nTODO Grothendieck construction diagrams\nHow does negativity, in particular \\(-1\\), come about conceptually in mathematics? The negative integers are added to (“logically constructed from”) the natural numbers when we want to have solutions to equations such as \\[x+1=0.\\] No natural number can be a solution to this equation. (Proof: the left hand side of the equation is the successor of \\(x\\), and according to Peano’s third postulate, zero is not equal to the successor of any natural number.) By embedding the natural numbers in the richer context of integers with positive and negative numbers, there is a solution to every arithmetic equation involving subtraction, the inverse operation of addition.\nWhen multiplication by \\(-1\\) is represented geometrically in terms of the number line, the negative sign not only creates new numbers, but also adds the concept of direction on the number line. A minus sign indicates a change of direction—a rotation of 180 degrees—on the number line. Understood in these terms, it is perfectly understandable that a change of direction followed by another change of direction cancel each other out:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[-1\\;\\times\\;-1=1.\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe puzzle about justifying the law that a “negative times a negative is a positive” by finding an interpretation for multiplying debts is based on an inadequate conception of a negative number. A better way to think about multiplying by \\(-1\\) is as a sign that indicates changing directions on the number line. To add \\(-5\\) and \\(-6\\) is to continue on the number line from the origin in the negative direction for a total of \\(11\\) units, and to multiply \\(-5\\) by \\(6\\) to go \\(5\\times6=30\\) units in the negative direction. However, to multiply \\(-5\\) by \\(-6\\) is to multiply \\(5\\) by \\(6\\) changing directions twice and ending up on the positive direction.\nThe construction of imaginary numbers from real numbers can be done in a way that is completely analogous to the construction of negative numbers from natural numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4.1.1 Negative Numbers: A Tale of Two Minuses\n\nMinus times minus is plus.\nThe reason for this we need not discuss.\n—W. H. Auden\n\nThere was skepticism about the negative numbers up until the 18th century. Negative numbers were introduced to have solutions to equations such as \\[x+1=0.\\] No natural number can be a solution to this equation. According to one of Peano’s postulates, \\(0\\) is not the successor of any natural number. We can expand the natural numbers by adding the negative integers. Negative numbers can, for example, be introduced to make it easy to calculate debts. If you owe \\(5\\) dollars to Abe and \\(10\\) dollars to Beatrice, but you only have \\(2\\) dollars, then you owe a total of \\(13\\) dollars—you have, so to speak, \\(−13\\) dollars. If you owe five dollars five times over, then your total debt is \\(5\\times(-5)=-25\\). However, does it make sense to ask how much you own if you owe \\(5\\) dollars a negative \\(5\\) times over?\nNegative numbers can be modeled by a pair of natural numbers that obey the following laws for addition and multiplication: \\[\\begin{aligned}\n(a,b)+ (c,d) &= (a+c,b+d)\\\\\n(a,b)\\times(c,d) &= (ac+bd,ad+bc).\n\\end{aligned}\\] Even the great mathematician Euler commented (incorrectly) upon the perplexing law, which we now take for granted: \\[\n(−1)\\times(-1)=1.\n\\] Prove the above law that a minus times a minus is a plus follows from the distributive law \\[\na(b+c)=ab+ac,\n\\] together with the facts \\[\n1+(−1)=0 \\quad (−1)\\times0=0 \\quad (−1)\\times0=0.\n\\] Extending the natural number line to the left, one generates the negative integers by multiplying the natural numbers by \\(−1\\). Geometrically speaking, multiplication by \\(−1\\) is a rotation of \\(180\\) degrees. The initially puzzling fact that \\((-1)\\times(-1)=1\\) corresponds to the geometric fact that two \\(180\\) degree rotations bring you back to the beginning. The integers are constructed as equivalence classes of ordered pairs of natural numbers and the negative integers are geometrically generated by multiplication by \\(−1\\).\n\n\n\n\n1.4.1.2 Complex Numbers: An Imaginary Journey\n\nImaginary \\(i\\) times \\(i\\) is minus one.\nLet me tell you why it can be done!\n\nThere has also been widespread skepticism about imaginary numbers even up to the present day. Imaginary numbers were introduced to have solutions to equations such as \\[\nx^2+1=0.\n\\] No real number \\(r\\) can be a solution to this equation. A real number is either positive or negative, but a positive times a positive is a positive, and a negative times a negative is also a positive and so \\(r\\times r\\neq1\\). Negative numbers can be seen as involving a rotation of 180 degrees. Complex numbers can be introduced to make it easier to calculate rotations without tedious trigonometry.\nWhat does \\(i\\times i=-1\\) mean in terms of rotation? Multiplying by \\(–1\\) is a rotation of 180 degrees. Geometrically speaking, multiplication by *\\(i\\) is a counter-clockwise rotation of \\(90\\) degrees or \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) radians. Two successive rotations \\(i\\times i\\) equal to \\(–1\\).\nComplex numbers can be modeled by a pair of real numbers that obey the following laws for addition and multiplication: \\[\\begin{aligned}\n(a,b)+ (c,d) &= (a+c,b+d)\\\\\n(a,b)\\times(c,d) &= (ac-bd,ad+bc).\n\\end{aligned}\\] Euler wrote “All such expressions \\(\\sqrt{-1}\\), \\(\\sqrt{-2}\\), etc. are consequently impossible or imaginary numbers….” (Algebra, 1770). We have the following cycle of facts: \\[i^1=i\\quad i^2=-1\\quad i^3=-i\\quad i^4=1.\\] If \\(c=a+ib\\), then the modulus of \\(c\\) is \\(\\sqrt{a^2+b^2}\\). By the Pythagorean theorem, this is the distance from the origin to the point \\((a,b)\\). The argument of a complex number \\(c=a+ib\\) is the angle formed by the positive real \\(x\\)-axis and the line from \\((0, 0)\\) to \\((a,b)\\).\nEvery complex number can be represented by a modulus and an argument using polar coordinates. Multiplication of complex numbers in this form \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& c=r[\\cos (\\theta)+i \\sin (\\theta)] \\\\\n& d=s[\\cos (\\rho)+i \\sin (\\rho)]\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] amounts to this: (1) the modulus of the product is the product of the moduli; and (2) the argument of the product is the sum of the arguments, i.e, \\[c \\times d=r \\times s[\\cos (\\theta+\\rho)+i \\sin (\\theta+\\rho)] .\\] Multiplication by a unit length is equivalent to pure rotation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4.2 From \\(-1\\) in Cartesian Coordinates to \\(\\sqrt{-1}\\) in Polar Coordinates\n\n\n\n1.4.3 From the Derivative to Infinite Series\nConsider Zeno’s arrow paradox. If you look at the arrow in flight at an instant—or indivisible moment of time—it is indistinguishable from the arrow at rest. However, the flight of the arrow is just an infinite collection of moments of time. How can an infinite collection of motionless arrows become the arrow in motion? One way to begin to unravel Zeno’s paradox is to develop the concept of instantaneous velocity. In order to distinguish the arrow in motion from the arrow at rest, we need to look at what is happening in the interval of time surrounding that instant of time. The notion of a non-zero instantaneous velocity is what is needed to solve Zeno’s paradox of the arrow. This concept is captured by the mathematical concept of the derivative.\nThe derivative is one of the two fundamental ideas of calculus. The derivative is a mathematical model of change. Given a real-valued function \\(f(x)\\), the derivative of \\(f\\) is the function \\(f'(x)\\) which is the rate of change of \\(f\\).\nConceptually, the derivative of a function is the rate of change of that function at a point in time. The *derivative of a function \\(f(x)\\) is the limit of the function in the interval of \\(\\mathrm{d}x\\) around \\(x\\) as \\(\\mathrm{d}x\\) goes to zero: \\[\\lim _{d x \\rightarrow 0}\\left(\\frac{f(x+d x)-f(x)}{d x}\\right)\\] Geometrically, the derivative of a function \\(f(x)\\) is the slope of the tangent line to its graph. In graphical terms, if we have the graph of \\[y=f(x),\\] then \\(f'(x)\\) is the slope of the line which is tangent to the graph of \\(f(x)\\) at the point \\(x\\) is the derivative. We can write this using Leibniz’s notation: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\mathrm{d}y}=f'(x).\\] In our example, the derivative of \\(f(x)=x^2\\) is computed as follows: \\[\\lim _{d x \\rightarrow 0}\\left(\\frac{(x+d x)^2-x^2}{d x}\\right)=\\frac{x^2+2 x d x-x^2}{d x}=2 x \\mathrm{d}x.\\] So the derivative, or rate of change, of the function \\(f(x)=x^2\\) is the function \\(f(x)=2x\\).\n\n\nThe Harvard mathematician and satirical songwriter Tom Lehrer put the definition of the derivative to music to a tune\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere’ll Be Some Changes Made.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou take a function of \\(x\\) and you call it \\(y\\),\nTake any \\(x_0\\) that you care to try.\nYou make a little change and call it \\(\\delta x\\),\nThe corresponding change in \\(y\\) is what you find nex’,\nAnd then you take the quotient, and now carefully\nSend \\(\\delta x\\) to zero and I think you’ll see\nThat what the limit gives us, if our work all checks, Is what we call \\(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\).

We have already encountered infinite series when discussing Zeno’s paradoxes. For example, Zeno’s dichotomy paradox involved the geometric series \\[\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2^n}=\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{8}+\\frac{1}{16}+\\frac{1}{32}+\\frac{1}{64}+\\cdots+\\frac{1}{2^n}+\\cdots.\\] Figuring out the sum of such an infinite geometric series depended on the observation that multiplying the series by the common factor of ½ results in truncating the first term: \\[\\begin{aligned}\nX&{}=\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{8}+\\frac{1}{16}+\\frac{1}{32}+\\frac{1}{64}+\\cdots+\\frac{1}{2^n}+\\cdots\\\\\n\\frac{1}{2} X&{}={}\\phantom{\\frac{1}{2}+{}}\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{8}+\\frac{1}{16}+\\frac{1}{32}+\\frac{1}{64}+\\cdots+\\frac{1}{2^n}+\\cdots.\n\\end{aligned}\\] So by subtracting half the series from the entire series, we simply have: \\[X=1\\] Another way of seeing this result geometrically is the following “proof without words”:  \\[X={\\color{red}\\frac{1}{2}}+{\\color{blue}\\frac{1}{4}}+{\\color{green}\\frac{1}{8}}+{\\color{orange}\\frac{1}{16}}+{\\color{red}\\frac{1}{32}}+{\\color{blue}\\frac{1}{64}}+\\cdots+\\frac{1}{2^n}+\\cdots.\\] The same idea for summing an infinite geometric series works, not only for \\(r=\\frac{1}{2}\\), but for any \\(r\\) whose absolute value is \\(&lt;1\\). In general, the infinite sum exists when \\(\\lvert r\\rvert&lt;1\\), \\[\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{a}{r^n}=a+\\frac{a}{r}+\\frac{a}{r^2}+\\frac{a}{r^3}+\\frac{a}{r^4}+\\frac{a}{r^5}+\\ldots+\\frac{a}{2^n}+\\cdots=\\frac{a}{1-r}.\\]\nNow the idea of power series comes about by replacing numbers with a variable resulting in the sum of an infinite series of power functions. Generally, a power series is of the form \\[\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n z^n=a_0+a_1 z+a_2 z^2+a_3 z^3+\\cdots+a_n z^n+\\cdots,\\] where \\(a_0,a_1,\\dots,a_n,\\dots\\) is some sequence of numbers. The reason for representing a function as a power series is that it is easy to compute the derivative of such a series term by term using the fact that the derivative of \\[f(x)=a_n x^n\\] is \\[f^{\\prime}(x)=(n-1) a_n x^{n-1}.\\]\nNow remember that the defining characteristic of the exponential function is that the derivative of \\(e^x\\) is just \\(e^x\\). How can we create a power series in which the derivative of the series, taken term by term, results in the very same series?\n\\[\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^n}{n !}=1+x+\\frac{x^2}{2 !}+\\frac{x^3}{3 !}+\\frac{x^4}{4 !}+\\frac{x^5}{5 !}+\\cdots+\\frac{x^n}{n !}+\\cdots\\]\n\n\nThe derivative of \\(1 = 0\\);\nThe derivative of \\(x = 1\\);\nThe derivative of \\(\\frac{x^2}{2 !}=\\frac{2 x}{2}=x\\);\nThe derivative of \\(\\frac{x^3}{3 !}=\\frac{3 x}{3 \\times 2\\times 1}=\\frac{x^2}{2 !}\\);\nThe derivative of \\(\\frac{x^{2}}{2!}\\) = \\(\\frac{2x}{2} = x\\);\nThe derivative of \\(\\frac{x^3}{3 !}=\\frac{3 x}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1}=\\frac{x^2}{2 !}\\); *The derivative of \\(\\frac{x^{n+1}}{(n+1) !}=\\frac{(n+1) x^n}{(n+1) n !}=\\frac{x^n}{n !}\\).\n\n\nSo taking the term-wise derivative is the infinite series itself! Now this is precisely the defining feature of the exponential function: \\[e^x=1+x+\\frac{x^2}{2 !}+\\frac{x^3}{3 !}+\\frac{x^4}{4 !}+\\frac{x^5}{5 !}+\\cdots+\\frac{x^n}{n !}+\\cdots;\\] this power series can be used to estimate the value of \\(e\\).\nThe following spreadsheet, computing the value of \\(e\\) for the first \\(12\\) terms, gives an approximation accurate to the first \\(9\\) decimal places.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPower Series Approximation of e\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(1\\)\n\\(1\\)\n\n\n1\n\\(1\\)\n\\(2\\)\n\n\n2\n\\(0.5\\)\n\\(2.5\\)\n\n\n3\n\\(0.166666667\\)\n\\(2.6666666667\\)\n\n\n4\n\\(0.041666667\\)\n\\(2.7083333333\\)\n\n\n5\n\\(0.008333333\\)\n\\(2.7166666667\\)\n\n\n6\n\\(0.001388889\\)\n\\(2.7180555556\\)\n\n\n7\n\\(0.000198413\\)\n\\(2.7182539683\\)\n\n\n8\n\\(2.48016\\text{e-}05\\)\n\\(2.7182787698\\)\n\n\n9\n\\(2.75573\\text{e-}06\\)\n\\(2.7182815256\\)\n\n\n10\n\\(2.75573\\text{e-}07\\)\n\\(2.7182818011\\)\n\n\n11\n\\(2.50521\\text{e-}08\\)\n\\(2.7182818262\\)\n\n\n12\n\\(2.08768\\text{e-}09\\)\n\\(2.7182818283\\)\n\n\n\n\nEuler’s power series gives a quick and accurate estimate of the value of e because the factorials in the denominator grow quickly diminishing the contribution of the successive terms, which quickly approaches zero. However, the value of power series does not necessarily lie in computing approximate values.\nLeibniz was proud of his discovery (1674) of the quadrature or Leibniz–Gregory series (Gregory discovered the series in 1671): \\[{\\color{green}\\frac{\\pi}{4}=1-\\frac{1}{3}+\\frac{1}{5}-\\frac{1}{7}+\\frac{1}{9}-\\frac{1}{11}+\\cdots}\\] In an infinitely-approximating way, Leibniz’s series provides a “solution” to the classic geometrical problem of squaring the circle. But Leibniz’s series is practically useless in calculating the digits of π. Not only does it converge extremely slowly but it does not yield digits that are stable. For example, if you compute the first five terms of the series then the partial sum is \\(0.8349206\\), which is within \\(\\frac{1}{11}\\) of the true value of \\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\), but not a single digit of the partial sum is correct!\nSimilarly, the mathematical value of the exponential power series lies not so much as its usefulness in calculating the digits of \\(e\\), but in itself providing conceptual insight into how to generalize exponentiation to unify two formerly distinct mathematical domains. The catalyst for the intuitive leap is the curious way in which the power series for the trigonometric functions of sine and cosine appear to be “contained” in the exponential power series: \\[e^x={\\color{red}1}+{\\color{green}x}+{\\color{red}\\frac{x^2}{2 !}}+{\\color{green}\\frac{x^3}{3 !}}+{\\color{red}\\frac{x^4}{4 !}}+{\\color{green}\\frac{x^5}{5 !}}+{\\color{red}\\frac{x^6}{6 !}}+\\cdots+\\frac{x^n}{n !}+\\cdots,\\] \\[{\\color{green}\\sin (x)=x-\\frac{x^3}{3 !}+\\frac{x^5}{5 !}-\\frac{x^7}{7 !}+\\frac{x^9}{9 !}-\\frac{x^{11}}{11 !}+\\cdots},\\] \\[{\\color{red}\\cos (x)=1-\\frac{x^2}{2 !}+\\frac{x^4}{4 !}-\\frac{x^6}{6 !}+\\frac{x^8}{8 !}-\\frac{x^{10}}{10 !}+\\cdots}.\\]\nThe terms of the sine power series are the odd powers and the terms of the cosine power series are the even powers. The question is how to account for the alternation of \\(+\\) and \\(-\\) signs. And to repeat, the sine and cosine functions are periodic and bounded, but the exponential function is non-periodic and unbounded. How then can an exponential function like \\(e^x\\) which rapidly expands to positive infinity be defined in terms of periodic trigonometric functions whose values are confined to the interval from \\(1\\) to \\(-1\\)?\nTo solve this part of the puzzle we need to explore the undue prejudice directed against imaginary numbers.",
