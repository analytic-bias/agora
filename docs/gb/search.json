    "text": "2.1 Modes of Truth and Modal Logics.\nHistorically, notions like necessity, possibility, impossibility, and contingency were thought of as modes of truth or ways in which a proposition could be true or false. Modal logic began as the study of the logic of these modes of truth.\nAristotle, in Chapter 9 of De Interpretatione, discusses modality in his famous example of the sea battle. Suppose the sea battle will be fought tomorrow. Then it was true yesterday that it would be fought tomorrow. So if all past truths are necessarily true, then it is necessarily true now that the battle will be fought tomorrow. A similar argument holds on the supposition that the sea battle will not be fought tomorrow. Aristotle proposed solving this problem of logical fatalism by denying that future contingent propositions have definite truth-values.\nUsing the ‘\\(\\Box\\)’ for ‘it is necessary that’, the principle that all necessary truths are in fact\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\Box P\\to P,\\tag{\\textbf{T}}\n\\]\n\n\n 2.1\n\n\n\nbut adding its converse that all truths are necessary truths:\n\n\n\n\\[\nP \\to \\Box P \\tag{\\textbf{V}}\n\\]\n\n\n 2.2\n\n\n\ncollapses the notions of truth and necessary truth.\nMedieval philosophers, concerned with such theological issues as articulating the nature of the Trinity, appealed to such modal notions as essence and accident, contingency and necessity in their labyrinthine theological reflections.[2] Akin to the problem is logical fatalism is the problem of theological fatalism: the problem of reconciling divine foreknowledge and human freedom. Saint Augustine (354 - 430) in his treatise On the Free Choice of Will considers an argument for theological fatalism proposed by Evodius. Evodius argued that “God foreknew that man would sin, that which God foreknew must necessarily come to pass.” We may set forth this argument for theological fatalism for a particular case as follows:\n\n\nIf God knew that Adam would sin, then, necessarily Adam sinned.\n\nGod knew that Adam would sin (because God is omniscient).\n\nTherefore, Adam necessarily sinned.\n\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas (1225 - 1274) in his Summa Contra Gentiles (part I, chapter 67) criticized this kind of argument as resting on an amphiboly. The critical first premise “if God knew Adam would sin, then, necessarily, Adam sinned” is ambiguous between\n\n\n\n\n(1a) It is necessarily the case that if God knows that Adam will sin then Adam will sin.\n\n\n\n 2.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1b) If God knows that Adam will sin, then it is necessary that Adam will sin.\n\n\n\n 2.4\n\n\n\nAquinas called (1a) the necessity of the consequence contrasting it with (1b) the necessity of the consequent. Using the ‘\\(\\Box\\)’ to abbreviate ‘it is necessary that’, the difference between these two can be made more perspicuous with symbols:\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\Box (P \\to Q) \\tag{1\\textit{a}}\n\\]\n\n\n 2.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n(P \\to \\Box Q) \\tag{1\\textit{b}}\n\\]\n\n\n 2.6\n\n\n\nSolving the famous theological problem of reconciling divine foreknowledge with human freedom may turn on exposing ambiguities of this sort.\nPerhaps the most famous theological application of modal logic is Saint Anselm’s modal ontological argument. According to Saint Anselm (1033–1109), it follows from God’s nature that it is necessary that God exists if God exists at all. Moreover, this conditional itself, being a conceptual truth, is itself necessarily true. We then have the following argument:\n\n\nNecessarily, if God exists, then God necessarily exists.\nIt is possible that God exists.\nTherefore, God (actually) exists.\n\n\nUsing ‘\\(\\Box\\)’ for ‘it is possible that’, the above argument can be symbolized:\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\Box(G\\to\\Box G).\\quad\\Box G\\quad\\therefore G\\tag{2}\n\\]\n\n\n 2.7\n\n\n\nThe question of whether Anselm’s argument is valid became a precise question when various systems of modal logic were proposed and developed in the 1960s.\nGottlob Frege (1848–1925), the inventor (or discoverer) of modern predicate-quantifier logic, relegated modality to autobiographical information about the speaker, and for many years logicians only investigated extensional logic.\nOne of the most puzzling validities, at least to the beginning logical students is known as Lewis’s Dilemma:\n\\[P\\land\\lnot P\\to Q,\\]\nwhich states “a contradiction implies anything”1. This implication follows from the inference rules of simplification, addition, and modus tollendo ponens2, which are themselves not particularly puzzling.\n1 Or “ex falso quodlibet”, in Latin.2 “mode that denies by affirming”\nThe following theorems are known as the paradoxes of material implication:\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\class{alref}{\\cssId{alref1}{}}\\lnot P\\to(P\\to Q)\\tag{T18}\n\\]\n\n\n\nlaw of denying the antecedent\n\n\n\n 2.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\class{alref}{\\cssId{alref2}{}}Q\\to(P\\to Q)\\tag{T2}\n\\]\n\n\n\nlaw of affirming the consequent\n\n\n\n 2.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\class{alref}{\\cssId{alref3}{}}(P\\to Q)\\lor(Q\\to R)\\tag{T58}\n\\]\n\n\n\n(\\(R\\) is typo?) conditional excluded middle\n\n\n\n 2.10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\class{alref}{\\cssId{alref4}{}}(\\lnot P\\to P)\\to P\\tag{T114}\n\\]\n\n\n\nConsequentia Mirabilis, “admirable consequence” [Cantor’s \\(\\Delta\\)?]\n\n\n\n 2.11",
