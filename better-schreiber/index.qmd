# Preface {.unnumbered}

Here hosted the wonderful book of Urs Schreiber, [Geometry of Physics --- Perturbative Quantum Field Theory](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/geometry+of+physics+--+perturbative+quantum+field+theory), but with potentially less typo and better typesetting ... and perhaps surprises.
