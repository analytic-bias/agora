# Non-associative Lambek Calculus in Tenses' Grammar

The specification of System **NL** was partially adapted from [Kokke, P. (n.d.). Formalising type-logical grammars in Agda.](https://www.lirmm.fr/tytles/Articles/Kokke.pdf), whose code was originally written in [Agda](https://gist.github.com/wenkokke/cc12b92a8a60696b712c).

The encoding of Reichenbach's tense system explored in this World is not a part of loc. cit.
